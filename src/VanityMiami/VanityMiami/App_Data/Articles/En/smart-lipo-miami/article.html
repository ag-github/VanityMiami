            <h2><strong>Smartlipo Miami</strong></h2>
            <h3>What is a SmartLipo?</h3>
            <p>Smart lipo is a less invasive method of liposuction treatment assisted by laser. This was created by the American company Cynosure, INC. Laser-assisted devices are meant to be highly effective at removing fat and unwanted tissue.</p>
            <h3>How does the Smartlipo procedure work?</h3>
            <p>During the Smartlipo, the area to be treated is instilled with a saline solution containing local or general anesthesia. Then, a small incision is made in the skin where the cannula (tube) holding the laser is introduced into the layers where the fat is concentrated. The energy that the laser fiber delivers directly to the fat cells will cause them to dilute; thus, they can be removed through the smaller cannula. The procedure is performed in an office environment and it does not need hospitalization. This technique will remove fat evenly with less bleeding and bruising than with traditional Liposuction.</p>
            <h3>What are the origins of SmartLipo?</h3>
            <p>The device used for this technique was created in 2006. It is the first laser device used for tumescent liposuction; this device was named SmartLipo by decision of its own creator. It was not until 2009, when it was approved by the FDA that it was put to use in treatments and surgical procedures.</p>
            <h2>What are the advantages of a <b>SmartLipo</b></h2>
            <p>For many surgeons, the use of this technology provides an improvement in the results of liposuction. It is designed to treat localized fat in specific areas. Using a calibrated laser makes it possible to break the fat deposits through the top layers of the skin, and seal blood vessels, helping to reduce inflammation and leaving the skin tighter and smoother. In addition, it involves minimal pain, less bruising and discomfort after the surgery, and a very swift recovery time. SmartLipo requires only one treatment.</p>
            <h2>Who is a good candidate for <b>SmartLipo</b> ™?</h2>
            <p>SmartLipo™ is oriented to patients with a normal BMI (body mass index), but with stubborn fat deposits located in specific areas on the body. Men and women who want to make their appearance more aesthetic and healthy through the elimination of that fat, that can be sometimes hard to remove, even with a diet and exercise alone, are good candidates for this procedure. Moreover, patients hoping to get a slimmer body, a more attractive abdominal contour, and make more visible their muscular shape. Healthy skin, with a good tone and texture are also a plus because you will respond well to the laser effects.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">What Happens After &nbsp;Smartlipo Surgery?</span></p>
            <p>After SmartLipo, patients will be alert. There is still some local anesthesia fluid effect which helps minimize the pain after surgery. They will not suffer of any nausea, or the “washed out” feeling related with general anesthesia. Swelling and bruising are faster healed. People may return to work and normal activities after two days of the procedure. Compression apparels are typically worn for two weeks after Smartlipo while for traditional liposuction are worn for six weeks.</p>
            <h2>What does&nbsp;<strong>SmartLipo Cost</strong>?</h2>
            <p>It depends on various factors, like the number of areas to be sculpted and the features of each area.

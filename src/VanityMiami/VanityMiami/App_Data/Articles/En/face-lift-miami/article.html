            <h2><strong>Facelift Miami, eyelid surgery</strong>, Introduction to Facelift, procedure description, problems, question and answers, cost and doctors that perform this procedure at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery in Miami</h2>
            <p>The lifetime facelift is a procedure that “defies gravity” according to one of Vanity Cosmetic Surgery’s best surgeons, Dr. Rafael Salas. By elevating and replacing rudiments of the face and neck, our surgeons make sure they leave the patient’s visage looking as new and rejuvenated as possible. The facelift surgery, or rhytidectomy surgery, is known as a procedure that reverses evidence of aging on the face. Statistics prove that the natural facelift has become increasingly popular among men and women worldwide; becoming the leading cosmetic surgical procedure. It is inevitable for individuals to experience the struggles of aging and natural factors that change and affect the looks and feel of the skin. Many lifestyle choices we make such as diet, sun exposure, and the uncontrollable factor of genetics can alter our overall appearance and become evident on our faces. When the face no longer reflects the youthful spirit and energy level one should feel, we begin to seek solutions. The traditional natural facelift has become one of the most popular methods individuals have turned to in order to improve their appearance and make them feel and look much younger. Vanity Cosmetic Surgery center in Miami has a team of highly qualified plastic surgeons that live to help patients look and feel their best.</p>
            <h2>A <strong>Facelift</strong>&nbsp;can improve certain aspects of the face such as:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The mid-face begins to sag</li>
                <li>Creases form below the lower <strong>eyelids</strong></li>
                <li>Creases form by the nose lengthening to the mouth corners</li>
                <li>Fat that has been displaced</li>
                <li>The loss of muscle tone around the chin and jawlines.</li>
                <li>Loose skin around the chin, mouth, face and eyes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The traditional mini facelift, known as rhytidectomy surgery, may be considered the most comprehensive way to address multiple signs of aging from the forehead to the neck and all areas in between. This method is best known to successfully reallocate fat, transposition muscle, and precisely remove excess skin. The reduction of excess or sagging facial skin, deep facial creases, redistribution of facial fat pockets, and tightening of soft tissues restores a more youthful contour to the face. Facelifts can be very rewarding if done properly and with the correct medical staff to meet your needs and fulfill your unique desires.</p>

            <h3>Forehead Lift at Vanity</h3>
            <p>The brow and forehead often show the first signs of aging. When surrounded by excess sagging, hooded eyelids, creases in the eye lids, or low heavy eyebrows, our appearance alters, and age can even be even more accentuated. This procedure involves one continuous incision beginning at the ears and running through the hairline where your surgeon will work to avoid a visible scar. For a rejuvenated, more youthful appearance in the upper portion on your face, this procedure will reverse the effects of aging.</p>
            <h3>Lower Facelift Procedure and Upper <a href="http://vanitymiami.com/eyelid-surgery-miami/" target="_blanck">Eyelids Procedure</a></h3>
            <p>The eyes may be the windows to the soul and one of the most enticing features of the face. Therefore it should be understandable why many patients with sagging or heavy eyelids choose to follow through with the eyelid procedure, or Blepharoplasty surgery. The lifting and repositioning of skin and fat, removal of “bags” and wrinkles, and overall brightening results leave patients looking more rested and youthful.</p>
            <h3>The Mid Face</h3>
            <p>Round facial contour and fullness of the cheeks can be reflective of youth and beauty. One of the earliest signs of ageing appears to be sagging cheeks, which often flatten and lengthen with age. As its name suggests, the mini lift procedure focuses on the central third part of the face, and/or the cheeks among the eyes and the upper lip portion. The mini facelift procedure readjusts the sagging fat of the cheek over the cheekbone, improving the tear trough and bagginess of the lower lids to restore youthful fullness and a naturally refreshed appearance.</p>
            <h3>Lower Facelift and Neck</h3>
            <p>In youth, the face appears full, smooth, and positioned high on the face. As we age, our skin, muscles and underlying tissues loosen and descend due to gravity and fat deflation. The benefits of this lower facelift procedure include: A reduction of sagging skin, reduction of jowls, recreation of a smoother jawline, elevation of the lower facelift and mid-cheek, reduction of marionette lines (the “bulldog” look), creation of a stronger chin as well as its underside, reduction of the turkey neck and a smoothing of the neck contour. During this procedure, the neck muscles are tightened and shortened.</p>
            <h3>Problems addressed with a facelift surgery</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of the elasticity in the face</li>
                <li>Muscle tone diminishes due to age</li>
                <li>Jawbones</li>
                <li>Creases between your mouth and the bottom of your nose</li>
                <li>Chin and neck lose their contour.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Up-to-date facelift methods, more urbane than ever, can be proficient in making you look ages fresher.</p>
            <h2>Long Lasting Facelift Procedures</h2>

            <h2>Preparing for surgery and what to expect:</h2>
            <p>
                Having a facelift surgery can change your life, but in order to prepare for surgery there may be certain steps to take such as; the elimination of smoking, drinking, and any other medications that may be potentially dangerous to consume two weeks before surgery.<br>
                Sufficiently preparing for facelift operation can keep you tranquil and well before, during, and after the process. Make sure to have the clothes you will need for discharge and transportation arranged for the aftercare of the surgery. A facelift surgery can be very rewarding with the right steps being followed.
            </p>
            <h3>Anesthesia for your Facelift</h3>
            <p>Patients may or may not have the option of choosing either an intravenous sedation and/or a general anesthesia for traditional surgery facelift and laser facelift. The doctor will always recommend the best option taking into regard that everyone articulates differently.</p>
            <h3>The incision</h3>
            <p>Although every facelift surgery requires a different technique, today we will be discussing the traditional facelift and how the incisions may be done. A traditional facelift incision usually starts where the hairline begins at the temples and continues over the ear ending by the scalp. Fat may also be used for the sculpting and molding of the new face . The fat acts like clay when renewing the face. The fat may be shaped and placed accordingly. Fundamental tissue may be relocated; usually the deeper layers of the face may also be lifted. The skin may then be rewrapped over the improved contours and leftover skin may be trimmed away. After that, a second incision made under the chin might be essential to additionally improve a maturing neck. In order to close the incision, a suture or adhesives may be used. This can be combined with laser face lifts for the best results.</p>
            <h2>Post-Surgery at Vanity</h2>
            <p>Once your surgery has been completed, a dressing should be placed over your face to minimize the swelling and bruising of the surgery. A slim tube might be added to drain or get rid of any extra blood or fluid that may or may not gather under the skin. After the surgery, the surgeon will always give details on the recovery and what to expect during the process. The recovery process usually takes a few months for all the swelling to diminish and for you to feel 100% comfortable again.</p>
            <h2>Ask your surgeon questions on what to expect after the Procedure:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After surgery, where will I be taken?</li>
                <li>What type of medication will I be prescribed?</li>
                <li>When do I know I have to remove my bandages?</li>
                <li>How do I know when stitches will be removed?</li>
                <li>When can I begin to lead my normal life again after the surgery?</li>

            </ul>

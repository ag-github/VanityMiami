            <h3><strong>Brazilian Butt Lift Miami</strong> Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The Brazilian Butt Lift procedure is a form of buttocks augmentation that not only reshapes, but also enhances the size of a patient’s buttocks so that it better fits the figure and provides an attractive, prominent rear end. In order to perform this surgery, fat from other areas of the body including back, abdomen, thighs and hips is removed through liposuction. The fat cells are purified and only the best tissue is used for injection into the buttocks at various depths for a natural look and feel.<br><br>
                The buttocks is an area that naturally tends to show signs of aging. Over the years, it can begin to drop and fail to keep the look people desire to have. With the Brazilian Butt Lift, individuals can fight this natural aging effect. The procedure is a safe form of plastic surgery that has the benefit of using the patient’s own tissue for long-lasting beautiful results.
            </p>
            <h3>Variations of the Brazilian Butt Lift</h3>
            <h4>Techniques</h4>
            <p>
                There is a great deal of variability in the aesthetic outcomes produced by the surgeons, but each one brings their own feeling to the surgery and produces a unique result. The various buttock techniques are as follow:
            </p>
            <h5>Miami Thong Lift</h5>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/miami-thong-lift.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Miami Thong Lift" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/miami-thong-lift-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
            <p>Brazilian Butt’s improved procedure, also known as Miami Thong Lift, leads in innovation as a fat grafting procedure. By making an incision down your center buttock crack, and liposuctioning the fullness that exists, the resulting scar remains largely hidden in the natural crevasse. The length of the scar depends on the fullness of the inner fold of the gluteus. It also depends on how much fat must be removed to correct the unpleasing aesthetic appearance. The Miami Thong Lift involves more than just buttock enhancement. It involves sculpting, contouring and defining shape. Fat grafting also plays a role in the procedure. The fat adds volume to the hips and buttock region. Sutures also play a major component. Specifically designed threads lift and round the buttocks. The knots in the threads, or sutures, must be covered by special cones which add comfort and ease to the presence in the body.</p>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <h5>The Butterfly Lift</h5>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/butterfly-lift.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="butterfly butt lift" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/butterfly-lift-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
            <p>The Miami Thong Lift alone might not be enough to perk up the rear end. A procedure called the Butterfly Lift may be able to bring about the desired results. This procedure results entails a more extensive scarring, which can be hidden along the top of the bikini line. The incision allows for the lifting of excess skin. The length of the scar and its extension towards the front will depend on how much work needs to be done.</p>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h5>The Inner and Posterior</h5>
            <p>Depending on the laxity of the inner and outer leg, an inner leg lift might be required. This occurrence becomes especially common in people who have lost a great amount weight or simply have developed very loose skin. The incision takes place along the groin crease, which aids in hiding it. The scar anchors to the bone which prevents the scar from migrating down the thigh into visibility. In case of extreme laxity, the scar would have to reach around from the groin into the crease of the gluteus followed by the lifting of the posterior and interior part of the leg.</p>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <h5>The C-Lift</h5>
            <p>The C-lift encompasses the Miami Thong Lift, the Butterfly Lift, posterior Leg Lift, and tightening up the entire rear region. The scar is in the form of a C-shape that creates a further lift in the upper/outer part of the buttocks. Patients who have excess skin or fat around the entire buttock area may be ideal candidates for the Miami C-Lift.</p>
            <h2>Ideal Candidates for a Brazilian Butt Lift</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, not every individual makes a good candidate for the fat transfer necessitated by a Brazilian Butt Lift. Good candidates for fat transfers need to be in good health, have realistic goals about the procedure, and have the pounds to spare in order to produce a good, long-lasting result. Thinner patients may not have enough fat to transfer, and therefore are less likely to be good candidates for Brazilian Butt Lift surgery. </p>
            <h3>Advantages of the <strong>Brazilian Butt Lift Miami</strong></h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/brazilian-butt-lift-miami-woman-butt.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="brazilian butt lift miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/brazilian-butt-lift-miami-woman-butt-thumb.jpg" width="219" height="136"></a></p>
            <p>
                Patients often choose to have a Brazilian Butt Lift procedure rather than gluteal implants. The Brazilian Butt Lift with fat transfer ensures natural-looking results. In addition, chances of rejection are greatly reduced. Moreover, because the Brazilian Butt Lift harvests fat via liposuction, patients receive the added benefit of an improved body contour in the areas targeted for fat cell harvesting.<br><br>
                Minimal scarring and discomfort are also benefits of this procedure as well as reduced risks of complications such as infection, wound rupturing along the suture areas, or implant exposure. Attractiveness, self-confidence and sex appeal are other benefits of the Brazilian Butt Lift.

            <h2>Risks involved in a Brazilian Butt Lift</h2>
            <p>Despite its safety and speedy recovery time, the Brazilian Butt Lift also has risks that must be taken into consideration. Some include hematoma, discomfort, excessive blood loss, asymmetry, and infections. The experience and skill level of your surgeon can be of utmost importance. Be sure to choose a board-certified plastic surgeon with experience, technical skill, and artistic ability such as the doctors here at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery.</p>
            <h2>How long do Brazilian Butt lift Results last?</h2>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/brazilian-butt-lift-garment.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" alt="butterfly-lift" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/bbl/brazilian_butt_lift_garment1.png" width="166" height="166"></a></p>
            <p>After a successful Brazilian Butt lift, the fat that remains will stay there for the rest of your life. Like the rest of the tissue in your body this fat will grow and age with you. It is important to follow a healthy lifestyle. Exercise can also help the buttocks maintain its shape and size.</p>
            <h2>How do I best prepare for a Brazilian Butt Lift?</h2>
            <p>
                Proper preparation for any type of surgery is the key to healing well. First and foremost, patients should not smoke a month prior to surgery. Smoking increases the risk of complications and decreases the take of the injected fat. Patients should avoid taking Aspirin or any other blood thinner unless otherwise indicated by the surgeon. Preparation of your home/recovery area will aid greatly in your tranquility and ability to fully rest and recover properly. This is the time to prepare for the aftercare as well. A ride to and from the procedure should be arranged as well as someone to check in or stay with the patient for at least the first 24 hours if not the first week.<br><br>
                Compile a list of things that must get done and seek help/aid from the spouse, friends or family. Prepare a comfort area with extra blankets and pillows. Extra towels laid on the sleeping area will prevent any stains in the case of bleeding.
            </p>
            <h2>Brazilian Butt Lift Procedure Description</h2>
            <p>There are general concepts surgeons must follow in order to obtain good reproducible results. The Brazilian Butt Lift is performed as an outpatient procedure under general or local anesthesia. The fat harvested from areas such as thighs, abdomen, back, or hip are cleansed and purified to isolate the highest quality fat cells to be used for injection to the buttocks. By placing the fat cells close to a blood supply and in between layers of muscle, the harvested cells would likely survive and not be reabsorbed by the body. Fat also contains stem cells which can turn into new tissue, so fat transfer creates new collagen which improves the skin texture and thickness. By injecting the fat at various depths, the patient will receive the highest permanent absorption rate and a firm bottom. Very small incisions are made into the buttocks to serve as the entry point for fat transfer. Areas of the buttock with low volume can be restored with fat, while lifting and tightening the skin. This new fullness restores the buttocks to a more youthful shape. The entire procedure may take from 90 minutes to four hours. The time frame depends upon multiple factors, including the amount of fat to be removed, treatment area, and the patients desired shape and size of buttocks.</p>
            <h2>What to expect after the Brazilian Butt Lift Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                Following the surgery, doctors will have the patient wear a special compression garment that will help the healing process and support the buttocks tissue. They should expect to refrain from putting much weight on their behinds for a few weeks following the procedure. Many providers say not to sit for prolonged periods of time for a full two weeks. The pressure may displace the fat or cause more of it to be absorbed. If they must sit, the patient should sit on a padded or cushioned surface and not on hard surfaces. They also  prefer to restrict patients from sleeping flat on their back, as these positions place a lot of pressure on the buttock areas, and this might suppress the desired outcome. Patients should be able to return to work, assuming it is not a job that involved rigorous physical activity, within 2 weeks. After about 2 months, they should experience a full recovery from any pain, swelling, bruising, and soreness. Patients should be able to resume intense physical exercise with sufficient amount of time. <br><br>
                On average, one should wait around one month to begin to feel normal, two months before resuming workout routines, and six months to see final results.

            <h2><strong>Brazilian Butt Lift Cost</strong></h2>
            <p>As the number of areas from which fat will be removed and transferred varies for every patient, Brazilian Butt Lift surgery costs also vary. Here, at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, prices range from $5000.00 to $15,000.00.</p>
            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions about the <strong>Brazilian Butt Lift Miami</strong></h4>
            <p>
                - I’m not happy about how my body looks since I gave birth. Will this procedure work for me?<br>
                Depending on the patient’s body type, another type of procedure, such as the Tummy Tuck, might be necessary along with the Brazilian Butt Lift.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Is there a minimum or maximum weight limit to qualify for a Brazilian Butt Lift? <br>
                The patient must have enough fat from other areas of the body including back, abdomen, thighs and hips to be removed through liposuction. The fat cells are purified and injected into the buttocks. Some overweight patients might have to lose weight before the Brazilian Butt Lift or opt for a different procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                - What is the difference between the Brazilian Butt Lift and the Butt Implants? <br>
                The Brazilian Butt Lift contours the body by removing fat from areas such as back, abdomen, thighs and hips and transferring it to the buttocks area. The butt implants are silicone or saline implants inserted into the buttocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Can I also do liposuction in other parts of my body along with this procedure? <br>
                Yes, other surgical procedures may be performed along with the Brazilian Butt Lift. Consult one of our surgical operators to know more about extra costs and concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Will exercise remove new fat cells in the buttocks?<br>
                The fat cells are removed from unwelcome areas of the body where losing fat is usually difficult. Because those fat cells have a type of “institutional memory”, when transferred from these areas, such as the hips or belly, they still act as though they are in the hips or belly. Even when transferred to the buttocks, these fat cells maintain their “institutional memory” and maintain their volume after the surgery. Therefore, even if a patient loses weight, they will still keep the curvy backside.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Is anesthesia care provided by board-certified M.D. anesthesiologists?  <br>

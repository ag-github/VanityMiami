            <h2>Whats a breast lift?</h2>
            <p>
                Breast Lift or Mastopexy, is a surgical procedure designed to correct the shape of the breast by tightening and removing excess skin, then, a new breast contour is created. If desired, a breast lift with augmentation can be performed to produce fuller, rounder breasts.<br>
                Women experience a lot of body changes when they lose weight, breast feed, and age; although exercise can help, a breast lift is often necessary and creates youthful look.
            </p>
            <h2>How does a Breast Lift work?</h2>
            <p>Breast Lift surgery takes between one (1) and three (3) hours and is performed under general anesthesia. This is an outpatient procedure. In cases where more skin removal is necessary, an overnight stay may be required.</p>
            <h2>Breast Lift surgical procedure can be done in three different ways:</h2>
            <h3>Anchor-shaped Breast Lift</h3>
            <p>Women with large breast or with terribly saggy breast require an anchor-shaped breast lift. In this surgery, the surgeon moves the nipple and the areola up a greater distance. To do this, the doctor must do both a vertical and a horizontal incision. The two incisions give the surgeon more freedom when shaping the new breast. This is a highly invasive procedure and requires the use of general anesthesia. In a way, this procedure is similar to the breast reduction. However, in breast lift the breast tissue remains intact, only skin is removed.</p>
            <h3>Vertical Breast Lift</h3>
            <p>This method removes excess of fat around the areola. First, the doctor makes a vertical incision. The incision goes from the base of the areola to the bottom of the breast. The doctor then removes excess skin along the incision. Afterwards, the doctor rolls back the tissue into place. This procedure helps reduce bagginess and helps reshape the breast. It also creates minimal scarring tissues. This surgery requires general anesthesia.</p>
            <h3>Concentric Breast Lift</h3>
            <p>Doctors do not consider the concentric procedure too invasive. They usually perform it on patients with smaller breast or with a lesser breast fall. It requires fewer incisions. When operating, the doctor draws a series of concentric circles around the areola. Gently, the doctor cuts around them, removes the skin and then pushes the areola upward, later sews the skin back in place. This method produces less scarred tissues.</p>
            <h2><strong>Breast Lift Miami.</strong> Additional Information</h2>
            <h3>Risk of Breast Lift</h3>
            <p>As with any surgery, there is always a chance of complications or a reaction to the anesthesia. Temperature of 101 degrees or higher, chills, acute morning sickness, excessive bleeding or drainage are common evidence of an infection, and must notify their physician. These are risks that can be reduced by following closely your physician’s advice before as well as after surgery.</p>
            <h3>Preparation before the Breast Lift Surgery</h3>
            <p>Women desiring a Breast Lift surgery need to have a healthy lifestyle so the healing process may be faster. This means to stay away from smoking for at least three (3) weeks prior to the surgery. The patient should be nutritionally balanced and have not taken any supplements that might contribute to excess bleeding. Patients need to complete preoperative testing lab work prior to surgery and a mammogram depending on the age and family history. Patients will shower and wash well with anti-bacterial soap the day before the surgery and arrange a friend or a family member to drive them home and to help out for a few days if needed.</p>
            <h3>The day of the Breast Lift Surgery</h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_lift/breast-lift-miami-5.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="breast lift miami, hialeah, broward" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_lift/breast-lift-miami-5.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a></p>
            <p>Breast lift is performed under general anesthesia and typically takes an hour to three hours. The incision is carried, excess skin is removed, the nipple and areola are moved to the uppermost position and the breast is again formed. The most common technique involves an anchor-shaped incision; thus the points are localized around the areola, in an upright line down from the nipple area and the bottom crease of the breast.</p>
            <h3>After the Breast Lift Surgery</h3>
            <p>Following surgery, for the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours the breasts will be bloated, bruised and uncomfortable, but the pain should be alleviated with the medicines prescribed by your surgeon. An elastic bandage or a surgical brassiere over gauze dressings are worn and will be substituted by a soft supporting bra within a few days. Sutures will be removed after about a week or two. Patient should prevent straining, bending and lifting heavy objects. These efforts increase swelling and bleeding. They also need to sleep in the back, to prevent putting pressure on the chest. Patients may feel less nipple sensation. It might take some time for the sensation to standardize and to get naturally. The incisions are either pink or red and lumpy during months after surgery, creams and massage will help get their normal color.</p>

            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_lift/breast-lift-miami-4.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="otoplasty miami, hialeah, broward" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_lift/breast-lift-miami-4.jpg" width="250" height="160"></a></p>
            <p>Getting back to normal is a gradual process. The Doctor gives the patient detailed instructions for resuming the normal activities. If the patient becomes pregnant, the surgery should not affect the ability to breastfeed since the milk ducts will be left intact. In case of any unusual symptom, the surgeon should be contacted.</p>

            <h3><strong>Breast Lift Miami</strong> Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>How do I know if the Breast Lift Surgery is right for me?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Breast lift surgery is a highly individualized procedure and you should do it for yourself, not to fulfill someone else’s desires or to try to fit any sort of ideal image. You need to have realist expectations. A good option for you to do it is if you are bothered by the feeling that your breasts sag, have lost shape and volume, your breasts have a flatter, elongated shape or are pendulous, or you have stretched skin and enlarged areolas just to mention some.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Will Breast Lift Surgery change the size of my breasts?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Breast Lift surgery does not significantly change the size of your breasts. If you want your breast to look fuller or smaller, you might want to consider Breast Augmentation or Breast Reduction.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>How long will my results last?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The final results of your breast lift will appear over the next few months as breast shape and position continue to settle. Incision lines are permanent, but will continue to fade over time. The results of your breast lift surgery will be long-lasting. Over time, your breasts can continue to change due to aging and gravity. But, you’ll be able to retain your new look longer if you keep your weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Women who have implants along with their breast lift may find the results last longer.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>What are some important facts?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">

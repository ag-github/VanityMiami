            <h2>What is a rhinoplasty?</h2>
            <p>Rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure performed on the nose. Its objective is to correct and structure the nose in order to create a naturally appealing look. A rhinoplasty also known as a nose job can improve functions of the nose that were previously affected such as injury, congenital defect, complications with breathing due to structural abnormalities, or simply restructure the nose so that it is in harmony with the rest of the face.</p>
            <p>Anyone considering a rhinoplasty should seek for a reputable and experienced specialist such as our surgical team at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery.</p>
            <p>Rhinoplasties or nose jobs in Miami stand amongst the most helpful surgical procedures, with innovative technology. The surgery can reduce the size of the nose, lift the nose, and effectively create symmetry in ways such as removing nasal humps or repairing a deviated septum to enhance the aesthetical appearance of the face.</p>
            <h2>What are some pre-operative procedures for rhinoplasty surgery?</h2>
            <p>Once the patient has decided to undergo surgery at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, certain instructions must be followed in order to ensure the wellbeing of the patient. The instructions will be provided by a medical professional attending the case. They will include a full explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure and information suggesting what to do in the weeks that follow.

            <h2>What can you expect after Nose Surgery?</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the patients that undergo rhinoplasty or a nose job do not experience significant pain after the procedure; however, the doctor may recommend pain relievers in case of postoperative discomfort. Some patients will complain of limited nasal respiration for the first few days due to the packing placed on the nose. The breathing discomfort results from intranasal inflammation, and as the inflammation subsides, the breathing will improve. Moreover, patients may expect bruising around the eyes that will begin to improve after the third day, though it can last up to two weeks. The doctor often recommends cold compresses which help minimize the swelling and pain. The surgical packing inside the nose and the splint and bandages around it will be removed within two days to around a week.<br>
                Patients must remember that blowing their nose must be prevented until the structures inside the nose have completely healed. Exercises such as heavy lifting, and bending should be avoided. Bypassing strenuous activity for three to six weeks after surgery is highly recommended. Sun exposure should also be avoided. If glasses must be used, finding a support system is necessary to avoid pressure on the bridge of the nose. The surgeon’s instructions should always be followed as they vary according to the patient’s condition.

            <h2>Does Insurance cover <strong>Rhinoplasty Costs</strong>?</h2>
            <p>Insurance does not necessarily cover surgeries meant for the enhancement of beauty; therefore, nose job would not be covered by insurance unless there seems to be evidence of nasal passageway obstruction in which the patient’s primary physician orders the surgery.</p>
            <h3><strong>Rhinoplasty Risks</strong></h3>
            <p>Rhinoplasty involves certain risks that should be carefully thought of and discussed before having a nose job. These risks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infection</li>
                <li>Change in skin sensation</li>
                <li>Skin discoloration</li>
                <li>Scarring</li>
                <li>Poor wound healing</li>
                <li>Nasal septal perforation (hole in the nasal septum)rarely occurs</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How much does a&nbsp;<strong>Nose Job Cost?</strong></h2>
            <p>Prices for a Rhinoplasty differ from state to state; however, it comprises the surgeon fee, outpatient center fee, anesthesia fee, prescriptions and medical examination fees. The nose job cost should be as important as choosing a board certified surgeon. National average cost ranges from $4500.00-$7500.00.

            <h2><strong>Rhinoplasty Miami</strong></h2>
            <p>A rhinoplasty is a procedure that only needs to be performed once in a lifetime if done correctly. Patients must be careful not to obstruct the passageway or damage the bone with strenuous exercises after the surgery. The nose surgery (rhinoplasty) can successfully correct many cosmetic concerns and insecurities. When deciding, make sure to look for before and after pictures, they may be helpful in seeking your preferred look or a good source for your structure. It may be necessary to keep an open mind since all people have different facial structures.</p>
            <h4>Complementary Procedures</h4>
            <p>When having these types of procedures, most patients undergo surgery in conjunction to Rhinoplasty. One of the most common being the augmentation of the chin using solid silicon or implant. This is usually done to improve the overall figure and profile of the clients face.</p>
            <h3>What is a <strong>Deviated Septum Surgery?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The septum is the thin wall between the nostrils that gives support to the nose. It is made of bone in the back and cartilage in the front. A deviated septum develops when the septum deviates to one side,or when the cartilage or bone is not straight, making one nasal passage smaller. This condition can lead to snoring, and breathing difficulties.<br>
                Although the most deviated septum cases are asymptomatic, there are some signs and symptoms associated such as obstruction of one or both nostrils, swelling of the intranasal tissues, nosebleeds or the &nbsp;preference to sleep on one side in order to improve breathing through the night.
            </p>
            <p>The deviated septum can be corrected with surgery. It usually takes from sixty to ninety minutes and it is an outpatient surgery. The surgeon will straighten the bent cartilage and replace the nasal mucosa over the bone and the cartilage by dissecting it from that area.</p>
            <h2>Which are the life cycles of the <strong>nose?</strong></h2>
            <p><a href="http://vanitymiami.com/?attachment_id=7518" rel="image-popup-no-margins"><img class="attachment-medium" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="rhinoplasty-illustration" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/rhynoplasty/rhinoplasty-illustration-300x1942.jpg" width="300" height="194"></a></p>
            <p>For an efficient cosmetic nose surgery (rhinoplasty), Vanity stresses a clear knowledge of the skeletal reactions to surgical involvement. To fully understand the responses, first, one must know the importance of aging when referring to the nasal outline. This should explain the process briefly:</p>
            <p>The nose starts life like a small, formless accessory, with few unique features. On smaller children, the wide nose seems to look the same because their noses start off as an unformed accessory. The nose remains the same until the age of puberty, then, the adolescent has a growth spur which triggers the elongation process of the skeleton on the nose tip. Lastly, in your teen years (sixteen) the nose has reached the full growth and has developed completely. This does not mean that the nose can no longer develop. Affected by many environmental aspects, the nose still ages with the body and can eventually develop a need for Rhinoplasty.</p>
            <h2>What can you expect after a <strong>deviated septum surgery?</strong></h2>
            <p>
                After a deviated septum surgery the patient is then placed a splint and surgical packing in the nostrils. This will help to keep the septum aligned while it heals. Patients should follow all the doctors’ instructions on how to care for the nose during the time of healing.<br>

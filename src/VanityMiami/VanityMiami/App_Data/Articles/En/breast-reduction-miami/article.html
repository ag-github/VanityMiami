            <h2><strong>Breast Reduction Miami</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Breast Reduction or reduction mammoplasty is the plastic surgery for reducing or removing excess fat, tissue and skin from the breast.<br>
                Women who usually seek this surgical procedure experience the effect of the weight of over-sized breasts. Disproportionately large breasts can be a source of physical symptoms such as, back and neck pain, deep strap marks, sometimes breaking the skin causing irritation and infection.<br>
                Breast Reduction helps these women restore proportion to their bodies and self-confidence. Men with conditions of Gynecomastia (enlarge male breast) may also get Breast Reduction.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of the Breast Reduction Miami</h3>
            <p>Women with large busts are often the subject of unwelcome comments and attention. Breast Reduction will benefit women with these problems. First, it will relieve them of chronic pain and constant self-consciousness. Second, it will reduce enlarged areolas, stretched skin and drooping breasts. Overall, Breast Reduction Surgery helps women achieve positive life changes.</p>
            <h3>How long does the effect of Breast Reduction last?</h3>
            <p>The breast size should remain constant. Aging and gravity might eventually alter the size and shape of every woman’s breasts. Skin quality, pregnancy, weight gain and losses and lots of exercises without proper support could also influence on the results term.</p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Breast Reduction changes the size of large breasts. It works by leaving behind some surrounding breast tissue. Once the extra breast tissue and skin are removed, the skin that is left is reshaped to make the new breast. It also raises the position of the nipples.</p>

            <h2>Types of Breast Reduction Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                There are different types of Breast Reduction Surgery techniques. The type to be used depends on the size and shape of the breasts to be reduced.<br>
                The most common techniques are:
            </p>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="http://vanitymiami.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BreastReduction-miami-1.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="breast-reduction-miami" src="http://vanitymiami.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BreastReduction-miami-1.jpg" width="300" height="366"></a></p>
            <h3>Vertical Scar Technique (lollipop incision)</h3>
            <p>
                This technique is less invasive and has the benefits of fewer scars. The surgeon will make a ‘lollipop incision’ around the areola and down the breast. After removing the tissue, and moving up the nipple a few millimeters, the surgeon gathers the remaining folds and sutures the inner and outer portions of the breast creating a support structure pillar.<br>
                This technique may not produce the best results for women with extremely large breast lines.
            </p>
            <h3>Horizontal Scar Technique</h3>
            <p>
                This technique is the most invasive one usually performed on women suffering from Macromastia. It consists of three (3) incisions. The first one is made around the circumference of the areola. The second one is made in a vertical position below the areola and extends downwards toward the lower portion of the breast. The third one is made horizontally under the breast and will connect with the vertical one. It looks like the shape of an anchor, which is why it is referred to as the anchor incision pattern or inverted T. Then, the surgeon removes the excess tissue between the nipple and the horizontal incision, moves the nipple upward and sutures the wound.<br>
                This technique gives the breast a more natural look and it allows for greater tissue removal.

            <h3>Free Nipple-Graft Technique</h3>

The symmetry between the two breasts will remain by liposuctioning the same amount of fat from either breast.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Fluid Accumulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Contact your doctor if you experience:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The first sign of infection which includes high fever above 104 grades Fahrenheit.</li>

                <li>If any stiches fall off before the appointed period.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Preparations before a Breast Reduction Surgery</h2>
            <p>Before having a Breast Reduction Surgery performed, the patient needs to get preoperative testing as directed, this includes mammograms, chest X-ray, blood tests, and other tests as needed. In addition, the patient must stop smoking one month before the procedure to help with the healing process. Any type of blood thinner such as aspirin or herbal treatments should also be stopped unless otherwise directed by the Doctor. The plastic surgeon will discuss any other special instruction as needed.</p>
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>There are different techniques used for this procedure. These techniques may involve the withdrawn of extra skin, tissue, and lift of the nipple depending on the desired results of the patient. This operation usually takes two to five hours. After the patient has been sedated and anesthesia administered, the surgeon proceeds to incise the area, remove the excess fat, skin; place the drainage tubes under the skin in order to drain any excess blood or fluid that may collect; then, the elastic bandages or support bra to decrease swelling and support the breasts as they heal.</p>
            <h3>Recovering after a Breast Reduction</h3>
            <p>Recovery time varies depending on different factors. Full recovery may take a couple of weeks or a month. There will be discomfort after the surgery which will be treated by the Doctor for healing and a smooth recovery. The length of time the dressings will be kept on depends on how quickly the wounds heal. The stitches will be removed at the clinic if they do not dissolve. Follow up appointments are very important to attend. The surgeon at Vanity will advise when the patient can resume the normal activities and return to work. Stretching and heavy lifting for up to six weeks after the surgery should be avoided. It is important to follow the Doctor’s specific instructions.</p>
            <h2>Breast Reduction questions and answers</h2>
            <p>Q- Who is a good candidate for breast reduction surgery?</p>
            <p>A- Good candidates for breast reduction surgery at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery include women who are looking to reduce the size of large breasts. Women, who experience physical discomfort due to the large size of the breasts, can be relieved through breast reduction. The breasts should be completely developed before having breast reduction surgery.</p>
            <p>Q- Is breast reduction permanent?</p>
            <p>A- Breast reduction surgery should be considered permanent. There is always the possibility that the remaining fat cells will swag and enlarge if you gain weight. The same might happen in the event of a pregnancy; since the tissues swell when storing milk. The consumption of hormones may also cause breast tissue to swell; it is quite possible to gain small amounts of breast tissue back.</p>
            <p>Q- When can I shower after breast reduction surgery?</p>
            <p>A- Our Doctors actually recommend that patients shower as soon as possible after surgery to help them feel refreshed and able to move up and about.</p>
            <p>Q- Can I breastfeed after a breast reduction?</p>
            <p>A- The answer of this question depends on the type of breast reduction technique used. If you have had a traditional breast reduction some of the milk ducts could be removed making it difficult to breastfeed. Some of the milk ducts in the vertical incision reduction will remain connected to the nipple. Scar-less breast reduction surgery has almost no risk of interfering with breastfeeding since the glandular and connective tissue remains untouched.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Breast Reduction Costs</h2>
            <p>Breast Reduction surgery cost goes from $ 3600.00 – $8000.00. There are different aspects that will influence this criterion such as breast size, duration of the surgery and so on. In occasions, patients would like to have performed a breast lift combined. This could also increase the cost of the surgery.</p>

            <h1><strong>Mommy Makeover Miami</strong></h1>
            <h2>What is a Mommy Makeover?</h2>
            <p>After pregnancy many women experience drastic changes in their bodies. Giving birth often results in excess abdominal skin and fat, loss of abdominal muscle tone, deflated breasts, stretch marks and weight gain and many women find it very hard to get back in shape. In spite of dieting and exercising, the loose skin in the abdomen area will not tighten and the breast may be smaller and lose their natural shape. However, thanks to plastic surgery, it is possible restore – or even improve – women’s post-pregnancy look. The Mommy Makeover, a combination of a Tummy Tuck and Breast Augmentation and/or Breast Lift, can often help these patients achieve good shape.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Mommy Makeover</strong> procedure typically involves different types of plastic surgeries:</h3>
            <h4>Tummy Tuck (abdominoplasty)</h4>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/tummy-tuck-miami-thumb7.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" title="Prior to Partial Abdominoplasty" alt="Mommy Makeover Miami- Tummy Tuck" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/tummy-tuck-miami-thumb7.jpg" width="300" height="230" /></a></p>
            <p>The abdominoplasty procedure entails removing fat and skin, in addition to the tightening of abdominal muscles. Muscles sewed together form a sort of internal girdle. This procedure is indicated for patients whose skin stretched beyond its elasticity. A protruding abdomen, disproportioned with the rest of the body, can be corrected with the tummy tuck procedure. The procedure facilitates the tightening of underlying stomach muscles which have loosened, weakened or separated. It also aids in the flattening and reshaping of the abdomen. Stretch marks can also be improved with this procedure, especially those below the navel.</p>
            <p><a href="/tummy-tuck-miami/">Tummy tuck</a> procedures vary in scope as well as area of concentration and can be frequently subdivide into categories. A complete abdominoplasty, from hipbone to hipbone in the abdomen, allows for contouring of skin, tissue and muscle, as all abdominal tissues can be exposed.</p>
            <p>A circumferential Abdominoplasty, often known as a Belt Lipectomy or a “body lift”, differs from a traditional tummy suck. It not only involves the abdominal area, but the hips, waistline and back. This operation takes care of significant amounts of loose (inelastic), hanging skin that extends from the abdomen to the sides, flabby buttocks and thighs; belly fat and repositions muscles. The procedure starts with a belt-like incision made around the waist, and excess fat and skin must be removed. Upper skin and tissue must be pulled down and lower skin and tissue pulled up giving you a tighter and more youthful looking body. The scar will fade over time.</p>
            <p>Mini-adbominoplasties targets fat deposits located below the navel and smaller patches of excess skin. During this procedure, the bellybutton will most likely not be moved. Sometimes, the bellybutton slips below the waist. The flap’s stitched back into its original position. The incision will be shorter than the complete abdominoplasty. Drainage tubes, after the surgery, may also be utilized. Recovery time’s shorter than traditional tummy tuck. Those who lost a moderate amount of weight prefer the incisions.</p>
            <h4>Breast Augmentation and/or Lift</h4>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/breast-augmentation-miami-2.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Mommy Makeover Miami - Breast Lift or Augmentation" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/breast-augmentation-miami-2.jpg" width="320" height="308" /></a></p>
            <p>Another typical procedure for the Mommy Makeover is correcting the breasts. While some moms can get an acceptable cosmetic result from augmentation alone or from breast lift (mastopexy) alone, many moms have a combination of breast volume loss and skin excess that requires simultaneous augmentation and breast lift.</p>
            <h5>Breast augmentation:</h5>
            <p>The Breast Augmentation surgery or augmentation mammoplasty is the surgical placement of breast implants to increase fullness, restore volume and improve symmetry of the breasts. The implants can be silicone gel or saline.</p>
            <p>
                Usually, the implants get placed in one of four locations: between the pectorals and the breast tissue, below the fascia, or fibrous tissue of the pectoral muscle, in the sub pectoral plane or right beneath the pectoral muscle (surgeons rarely perform this technique because it requires removing the muscle off the ribs. This technique may cause the breast to move in a deformed fashion).<br />
                There are also different locations for the incisions, which depends on the body type and personal preference of the patient. The Inframammary incision involves an incision below the infra-mammary fold. The Periareolar technique involves an incision around the borders of the areola. Transaxillary involves an incision in the armpits; and the Transumbilical breast augmentation (TUBA).
            </p>
            <h5>Breast Lift:</h5>
            <p>
                Breast Lift surgery raises and makes breasts firmer. It removes excess breast skin, in addition to tightening the tissue to adapt to the breast’s new shape. At Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, this procedure involves removing and replacing of the nipple-areola. The procedure does not affect the breast sensitivity and it also does not increase the chances of getting breast cancer. During the surgery, the surgeon removes the excess tissues and overstretched ligaments and moves the areola higher and decreases its size.<br />
                Breast lifts can be done in three different ways: the Concentric Breast Lift Miami Method, performed on patients with smaller and less deflated breasts; the Vertical Breast Lift Method, a method that removes excess of fat around the areola; and the Anchor- Shaped Breast Lift Procedure, for women with large or with extremely saggy breasts.
            </p>
            <h4>Liposuction</h4>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami-1.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Mommy Makeover Miami - Liposuction" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/mommy_makeover/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami-1.jpg" width="229" height="200" /></a></p>
            <p>
                Liposuction, or Lipoplasty, is a cosmetic surgical procedure in which excess fatty tissue is removed from under the skin by suction. The procedure can place greater accentuation on the body’s natural contours. Liposuction uses a hollow stainless steel tube known as a cannula and a suction device known as an aspirator to remove fat from the body’s subcutaneous deep fat layer through a variety of different possible techniques. Liposuction surgery can be used to treat fat pockets in many parts of the body including: abdomen and waist, thighs, hips and buttocks, arms, legs and back.<br />
                There are different and improved techniques for Liposuction: Suction Assisted Liposuction (SAL), a traditional method that uses a small cannula attached to a pressurized vacuum; Power Assisted Liposuction (PAL), a mechanical cannula that extracts fat with smaller incisions and a more precise and shorter surgical experience; and Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction (UAL), a technique that uses ultrasound to liquefy the fat, which makes it easier to remove.

            <h2>Risks involved in Mommy Makeover</h2>
            <p>As all invasive cosmetic surgeries, there can be risks for side effects and complications. This surgery is a potentially challenging one and requires thoughtful preoperative evaluation and planning, and careful attention to detail in the operating room.</p>
            <p>The most common risks include: bad reaction to anesthesia, infections, internal bruising, hematoma, capsular contracture, implant ruptures, alteration of nipple and breast sensation, bleeding, soreness, swelling or numbness, fluid Imbalance and embolism.</p>
            <p>Rarely, the patient may suffer from deep vein thrombosis after the operation. These side effects can be easily treated. However, some patients may not be able to breastfeed in the future. This occurs because breast lift removes most of the milk ducts that leads to the nipple</p>
            <h2>How do I best prepare for a Mommy Makeover?</h2>
            <p>Proper preparation for any type of surgery is the key to healing well. First and foremost is not smoking. Smoking increases the risk of complications. Patients should avoid taking Aspirin or any other blood thinner unless otherwise indicated by the surgeon.</p>
            <p>Be sure to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Proper nutrition plays a key role in healing properly. You must have a high protein diet, for at least 3-5 weeks.

            </h5>
            <div class="toggle-content ">
                The breast lift does not last forever. Many factors such as aging, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and weight loss may cause your breast to sag again. It also depends on the collagen. Patients with good collagen experience optimal results. Also, if the patients have large breast they will start to sag a lot sooner.

            <div class="toggle-content ">
                It is hard to tell… Some women cannot breastfeed even before going to the procedure. Others may be affected by the length and time of the procedure. Most doctors avoid damaging the areola and the nerves connected to it. If the surgery gets done correctly, the patient may not lose her ability to breastfeed. Still, it is not recommended, because breastfeeding may cause your breast to sag again.

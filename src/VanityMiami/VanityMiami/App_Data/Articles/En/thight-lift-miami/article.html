            <h1>Thigh Lift Miami</h1>
            <h2>Cosmetic Surgery of the Thigh or Thigh Lift</h2>
            <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In the United States, obesity is the most common of all health issues where 2 out of every 3 americans is overweight. Many people who become unhappy with their bodies and health begin looking after heavy diets and intense exercising causing incredible weight loss. Once this occurs, the person is left with a lot of excess skin that had developed before the weight loss had taken place. The excess skin has by then lost all of its elasticity making the upper thigh what appears as flabby or wrinkled.</span></p>
            <p>The thigh reduction or thighplasty procedure is a cosmetic surgery that is performed to ideally remove excess skin, wrinkles, and fat at the top and bottom of the thighs to restore firmness to the fallen muscle, improving its overall appearance. The thigh lift may be performed in conjunction with other procedures such as liposuction or a butt-lift.</p>
            <p>Excess skin can cause limitations, both aesthetic and functional. Due to the rubbing of the excess skin, irritation might occur when walking or an intense burning sensation. A thigh lift (also called Thighplasty) can offer you a final solution.</p>
            <p>Vanity Cosmetic Surgery provides a surgical procedure designed to improve the shape and smoothness of the legs through a thigh-lift or thighplasty to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve the contour of anyone who, for personal reasons, thinks that their skin is sagging.</li>
                <li>Correct shape and smoothness of thighs after major weight loss.</li>
                <li>Allow the patient to feel more comfortable in certain clothes, making their life more comfortable every day.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Traditional Thigh Reduction Surgery</h2>
            <p>At Vanity, the incision is made in the inner thigh near the groin or may need to be made by the gluteal fold. Elliptical segments of skin and underlying fat are removed from areas of the thigh and the remaining skin and tissue are lifted and repositioned to achieve a firmer and tighter looking thigh. After surgery you will require maintenance elastic bandages to support the area.</p>
            <p>The procedure usually takes about 2-3 hours, depending on the extent of the work required, and whether other procedures such as liposuction are involved. The resulting scar is from the groin to the infragluteal groove, going front to back along the sides of the genitals and perineum.</p>
            <p>Incisions are made to ensure that the scars are as inconspicuous as possible in the inguinal crease or in the gluteal fold. Through the incision liposuction is performed to facilitate pulling of the skin and remove excess skin. After the incisions are sutured carefully, drainage tubes are left for a few days after surgery. It is important to discuss each of the techniques to understand the implications of the methods we recommend. Possible treatments that are offered at Vanity Cosmetic Center:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lifting mid thighs: Most inner side of the thighs.</li>
                <li>Lifting of lateral thighs: Front outer thighs.</li>
                <li>Lifting medium more lateral thighs: Most front inner and outer thighs.</li>
                <li>Lifting of thighs and legs: Upper thigh.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>SmartLipo Thigh Lift</h2>
            <p>Smartlipo Thigh Lift is a surgical procedure known as a suction-assisted thigh lift and is performed with a wand called a cannula. Vanity Cosmetic uses laser liposuction for thigh reduction on both men and women, because it is the quickest and least painful process with the best results. After marking the areas of reduction, the specialist will give the patient a little sedation and anesthesia. The cannula is placed under the skin through a small incision passing along the entire area to extract the fat. This procedure does not remove cellulite but women who have fat on the inner thighs yet still retain a good skin elasticity are best suited to undergo the laser lipo thigh procedure.</p>
            <h2>Cost of a Thigh Lift Procedure</h2>
            <p>Thigh lift procedures vary in their extent and because this is what will determine the exact costs of the procedure, an exact price cannot be given without a prior consultation with one of the surgeons at our facility who will be performing the surgery. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgery, in 2013 the average price for a thigh lift was between $5,000 and $8,000. Surgical costs are determined by the complexity of the procedure, length of operation, type of anesthesia and post-operative care.

            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the duration of surgery, you will be allowed to go home after a few hours, or you may need to stay in hospital for a couple of days. Most patients require at least 14 days of recovery time after surgery.</li>
                <li>To accelerate the recovery you should wear compression bandages for at least a month.</li>
                <li>The scar becomes less visible over time and in all cases is camouflaged by undergarments or bathing suits,</li>
                <li>You will feel tired and annoying some days after surgery, you should be under bed rest for one or two days, without subjecting tension to the sutures.</li>
                <li>You can begin taking on normal life activities after 6 to 7 days. Most of your discomfort can be treated with medication.</li>

                <li>The strange skin sensations and swelling decreases significantly in nearly three weeks.</li>

                <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Your legs will probably be sensitive to direct stimulation for two to three weeks, so you should avoid physical contact. After this, you may progressively return to normal duties and activities.</span></li>
                <li>The scars will be hardened and pink for at least six weeks. Although healing can take several months.</li>

                <li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Infection, reaction to anesthesia, fluid or blood under the skin, nerve damage, blood clots, and irregular or asymmetric thigh appearance may occur after surgery.</span></span></span></li>
                <li>As with any surgical procedure, bleeding following the operation may cause edema and discomfort.</li>
                <li>A small percentage of patients may develop an infection. This can happen at any time, but it is most common in the first week after surgery.</li>
                <li>Some patients experience reduced sensitivity or numbness on areas near the incisions. These symptoms usually disappear over time, but may be permanent in some patients.</li>

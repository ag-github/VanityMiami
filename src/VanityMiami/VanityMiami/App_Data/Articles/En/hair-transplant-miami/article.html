            <p><b>What are the causes of hair loss or alopecia?</b></p>
            <p>Alopecia or hair loss is a condition that causes a person to lose hair. Numerous factors are related to hair loss and range from aging processes and injury, to biologic dysfunctions such as diseases and disorders or the use of drugs and medications. Men’s patterned hair loss is usually due to the influence of levels of hormones. Women’s patterned hair loss may be caused by menopause as the female hormones decrease.</p>
            <p><b>What is Alopecia Areata?</b></p>
            <p>Alopecia areata is a disease that makes the individual lose or shed hair. It appears when the immune system attacks its own body, in this case the hair follicles, where hair growth begins to develop. Alopecia areata is mostly typical in people younger than twenty, but children and adults three years and older may also be affected as it affects men and women equally. These bald areas often regrow the hair automatically in about six months to one year.</p>
            <h3>Types of <strong>Hair Transplant</strong> techniques</h3>
            <p>There are several types of <strong>Hair Transplant techniques</strong>. At Vanity Cosmetic Surgery only two of these methods are applied:</p>
            <p><b>Follicular Unit Extraction:</b></p>
            <p>This is a method of hair transplant in which hair follicle units containing one to four hairs are extracted from the back or side of the head, where the hair follicles are denser, and transplanted to the desired area; usually in the front of the head, for a natural look.</p>
            <p><b>Microscopic Follicular Unit Hair Transplant:</b></p>
            <p>Another method of hair transplant used with the help of high-powered microscope. The microscope helps augment the graft yields, providing more coverage and better hair transplant outcomes. The microscopes are also very useful for patients with grey or light colored hair. Once the hair is transplanted, it will grow in groups of one to four hairs.</p>

            <h3>How is the Follicular Unit Transplant performed?</h3>
            <p>
                Hair Transplant can enhance the appearance of individuals who are balding. During a hair transplant the patient’s area to be treated will be photographed to be able to compare it pre and post-procedure. Once the donor area has been prepped and the hair has been trimmed, local anesthesia is applied to numb the scalp; some patients will also receive medication to feel relaxed and comfortable during the procedure. Then, the surgeon will indicate the hairline location using a surgical pen and proceed to remove the strip of tissue at the back or side of the head in the donor area. These are the hair follicles that will make the hair restoration possible.<br>
                Now the staff will prepare the follicular units for placing. Meanwhile, the patient will be able to walk around, talk, read or watch a movie. The donor strips will be split into follicle units comprised of one, two, three or four hair follicles.<br>
                Next, the patient will receive local anesthesia again now in the recipient area. The doctor will make minuscule incisions to place each of the follicular units. Once all the units have been placed, the surgeon will make sure that all the grafts are properly in place and the hair restoration surgery is ended. Post-operative instructions are then disclosed. The first few nights the patients will sleep with the head elevated with pillows.
            </p>
            <h3>How is the follicular Unit Extraction performed?</h3>
            <p>For the follicular unit extraction, some level of shaving needs to be done at the donor site since the hair will be easier to be removed if it is short. The scars will be very small; if the patient is completely shaved the scars will look like miniature dots spread in the back of the head. Individual follicular unit grafts are removed one at a time using an instrument with an insignificant diameter to make a tiny pouch in the skin around the follicular unit to seclude the graft. Then, the graft is pulled from the scalp and prepared for implantation.</p>

            <h2>What are the <strong>risks of a Hair Transplant</strong> surgery?</h2>
            <p>Like any other surgical cosmetic procedure, individuals desiring a Hair Transplant procedure should be healthy or surgery is most likely to be unsuccessful. Bleeding and infection are examples of the risks of this procedure. There is always the possibility of scarring and the unnatural looking outcome of the new hair growth.</p>
            <h2><strong>Hair growth treatments</strong> after Hair Transplant surgery</h2>
            <p>Hair growth treatment after a hair transplant is not typically advised. Some surgeons recommend Rogaine and Propecia after the operation. Rogaine can be applied directly into the scalp where the hair growth is desired. This approach has not been studied enough to determine its effectiveness.</p>
            <h2>Who is a good candidate for Hair Transplantation technique?</h2>
            <p>Men or women are not excluded to hair loss, though it is more frequent in men than in women. Doctors are the only ones who can determine who a good candidate is for a Hair Transplant. It all depends on the extent of the hair loss and the amount of hair accessible in the donor area.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">How much does </span><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Hair Transplant Cost</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">?</span></p>
            <p>The cost of Hair Transplant technique varies from patient to patient determined on a per graft basis according to the individual’s replacement needs. The price may go for example from 1.00 dollar to 5.00 dollars per follicle. In order to obtain more accurate information on the Hair Transplant cost it is advisable to come to Vanity Cosmetic Surgery and have a free consultation with one of our experts to find out if Hair Transplant surgery is an excellent choice for you.</p>
            <h3>Two chief ways which giver/donor grafts may be removed currently:</h3>
            <ul class="beforeafterpics">
                <li>
                    <img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Hair Transplant Strip Excision" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/hair_transplant/hair-transplant-strip.jpg" width="130" height="111"><br>

                <li>
                    <img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Hair Transplant FUE" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/hair_transplant/hair-transplant-fue.jpg" width="130" height="111"><br>
                    Follicular Unit Extraction.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Strip gathering may be the most common method for eliminating hair and sacs from a giver area, furthermost ordinarily the part at the posterior and lateral area of the scalp. A sole-bladed scalpel, double-bladed scalpel, or 3 bladed scalpel too can be used to eliminate strips of skin bearing hair from the givers location. Each opening must be coordinated to insure that the whole hair sacs may be detached. Once detached, the strip must be divided into follicular parts.</p>
            <p>Follicular Unit Extraction(FUE) may be achieved in a solitary elongated period or numerous minor meetings. Follicular unit extractions could be measured to be further time overwhelming, dependent on the worker’s ability, and there could be boundaries on patient application. The compensations of this method over the conformist strip harvest could be that may not leave a direct scar, and entirely, the process makes very small or no post-operation discomfort and uneasiness. Stem tissues and/or skin papilla lockups were exposed in hair sacs. Study on the follicular cells might lead to achievements in doctoring bald headedness through hair growth. Hair growth may be known to be in course of being industrialized by the ARI.</p>
            <h2>Concerning the Up-to-date methods used in Hair Transplant:</h2>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/hair_transplant/hair-transplant-spot.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="hair transplant miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/hair_transplant/hair-transplant-spot-thumb.jpg" width="350" height="326"></a></p>
            <p>Male or Female Genetic Hair Loss only disturbs the highest and anterior of an individual’s scalp. This occurs due to the sacs in this area that encompass receptors delicate to the hormone that produces hair damage. If the hair has been taken from the side or back of the scalp in which can be area where the hairs should not be delicate to hereditary hair loss, and relocated to the highest point or anterior, the hair typically remains growing and creates hair for life.</p>
            <h3>Hair Transplant Side effects</h3>
            <p>A temporary side effect that can occur early in the healing process can be hair loss due to shock loss. This happens because the hair follicle does not necessarily like where it has been placed therefore it decides to fall off. Another common effect could be patching. Usually on the average person fifty to one hundred hairs fall daily. Like most procedures the common effects include inflammation of the head and/or forehead. Medication can be prescribed if it continues to become undesirable for the patient. Scratching should try to be avoided since scratching an itchy scalp can lead to scabs and dry skin. It may be appropriate to have a proper moisturizer for these situations.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Questions that should be asked to your Dermatologic Surgeon:</span></p>
            <p>It can always be good to know how many procedures the surgeon has performed on this particular surgery. Do not be afraid to ask questions that linger on your mind. The institution in which they graduated from can also be important when finding the right surgeon for you. The most serious hair refurbishment surgeons belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery; an honor to obtain. Ask whether the surgeon removes the donor strip and whether he/she makes all the recipient sites or whether different associates of the medical team transport out the phases of the process. Questions must be asked to insure the patient’s satisfaction throughout the entire process. No question will be considered incorrect or unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Selecting to have a hair transplant operation can be a vital decision. Seeking a treatment that will permanently modify your look. Currently in this procedure-dominated medicinal business, many surgeons make choices grounded upon their own commercial benefits instead of contemplating what is &nbsp;in the best interest of the patient undergoing the hair transplant. Consequently, it is crucial that you take the time to research your concerns on both, the hair transplant method you will undergo and the physician doing the procedure. Having this in mind will assure you of having a safe procedure with minimal to no complications. Any type of surgery requires the time to research and consider different factors regarding the procedure. When having a Hair Transplant be sure to know your facts and the areas in which you desire to have hair relocated. The procedure seems to be painless and quick to recover.</p>

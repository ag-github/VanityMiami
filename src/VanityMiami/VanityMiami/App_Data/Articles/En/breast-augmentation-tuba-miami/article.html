                TUBA, or Trans-umbilical breast augmentation, involves introducing a breast implant from the belly button. It uses the abdominal area to get the implants up to the breast area. When it gets to the breast area, it pours a breast implant gel. This procedure must not be used on someone who already had a breast implant. Doctors recommend operating on “virgin” skin. Via the navel area, the doctors can avoid scarring the tissue. In the end, the procedure does not produce any new scars. The operation takes about 30-40 minutes. It takes less time to recover from a Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation surgery, than a regular breast implant. Since the operation time shortens, the anesthesia related complications do not appear so often. It also has a low risk of infections and other complications. When choosing to undergo TUBA surgery, make certain that the doctor has a lot of experience with the TUBA technique. The surgery has a lot of margin of error. We, on Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, perform the most TUBA surgeries in Florida. With much experience, we know how to avoid errors.

            <h2>How Does Transumbilical Breast Augmentation Surgery work?</h2>
            <p>At the start of the operation, the doctor makes a small, 2 centimeter, incision in the navel. Using endoscopic assistance, the doctor creates two tunnels for each implant. When the implant reaches the chest, the doctor injects the silicone-gel implants bellow the breast. When the implants have saline solution instead of silicon, the doctor may fill them up from the inside. This part of the procedure does not use endoscopic assistance. When placing the implants bellow the muscle, the doctor dissects the pectoral muscles to accommodate the breast. In other cases, he places it over the muscles. In both cases, the doctor then manually places the implants in their respective locations. Since the surgery does not take a long time, it usually uses local anesthesia. If the implants rupture, the doctor can do TUBA surgery to replace the bad implants with new ones. The replacement surgery usually hurts less. It uses the old tracts created the first time, in order to replace the transplant. In rare cases, the tracks leading up to the breast remain visible.</p>

            <h2>Preparations before the <strong>Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation Operation</strong></h2>
            <p>Before any operation, you must prepare emotionally. You need to have a realistic expectation of the end results. You need a clean bill of health before undergoing the Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation operation. Before hand, you must tell your doctor the size of the cup you wish to have. To prevent infections, you need to wash your skin and hair with anti-bacterial liquid soap. You should stop taking aspirin or any other anti-inflammatory, for at least two weeks, before going to surgery. Have your doctor give you a list of all medicines you should avoid before surgery. Ideally, anyone regardless of age can get a TUBA surgery. However, women with thin torsos cannot get super large implants. The torso cavity simply would not allow it. The patient should stop smoking for at least two weeks, before getting operated. They should avoid surgery if they have high blood pressure, diabetes or heart problems. When those conditions normalize, then you may undergo a Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation.</p>

            <p>On the day of the operation, the doctor will give you a mild sedative. When you relax, his attendants will take you to the operation room. There, the doctor injects you with local anesthesia. After the surgery, you can go home after a few hours. Have a friend drive you home, since the anesthesia leaves you a bit groggy.</p>
            <h2>Vanity Surgery Recovery</h2>
            <p>For <strong>Transumbilical Breast Augmentation Miami</strong>, the recovery period ranges from 1 to 2 weeks. After the first two days, the patient may resume regular activities. The patient should avoid putting pressure on the beasts. Due to the small incision, the patient may be able to take a shower. The patient still needs to be careful with the surgery tape. During those two weeks, the patient should attend scheduled checkups. It has been reported that some patients experience a lot of pain, after six days. Patients must get painkillers before the surgery. At home, they may resume their daily routines. They may go back to work after the first week. Have a friend check up on you from time to time. While you recover, you must eat a healthy diet, and avoid smoking. Also, massage your breast and your belly during the operation recovery period. This will erase the twin tracks left on your belly.</p>
            <h2>Minor Complications with TUBA Breast Implants Florida</h2>
            <p>If the capsule contracts the patients may require open surgery to revise the problem. This cannot be corrected with TUBA surgery. In rare cases, the paths leading up to the breast do not fade. However, such cases only occurred, during the development stages of the procedure. These days all tracks tend to disappear over time.</p>
            <p>In a few rare cases, the patient suffers from mild infections or hematomas. If the muscle gets scrapped, the hematomas may feel particularly painful. If you experience any sharp pains, you should contact your doctor. The main issue with TUBA surgery has to do with the margin of error. Inexperience doctors may end up giving their patients really messed up, asymmetrical implants. For this surgery, it takes the experienced hand to obtain optimal results. If any asymmetry occurs the doctor can fix it on the spot.</p>

            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Will the TUBA tracks take forever to go away, Doctor?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Normally, tracks get smoothed out after a few weeks. Massaging the area helps. In some rare cases, the tracks won’t smooth out.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I don’t want asymmetrical breast!</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Worry not, Dr. Hasan created this procedure. He has never had any asymmetrical problems. Plus, most patients naturally have asymmetrical breasts.

            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Does the implant warranty still apply <strong>Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation?</strong></a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The implant simply gets rolled up and placed into your breast.

Will it cause a problem?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">If you just got the navel pierced, and it gets infected, you might have to remove the piercing and let it heal before surgery.

            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>For how long will my navel and my tummy feel sore after the operation?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">It depends from patient to patient. Most of the discomfort originates from the pectorals muscles which get dissected from the wall to accommodate the breast implants. The abdominal muscle hardly gets affected.

Can it be done?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Some doctors say it cannot be done, i.e. that they cannot do it. More experience doctors like our very own Hasan can place the implants partially beneath the pectoral muscle. It all depends on the doctor’s experience.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I heard the FDA does not approve Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation. Why do they not approve it?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The FDA has never approved any breast enlargement surgeries. They approve the instruments and the materials used for the surgery, but not the process itself. This new procedure does not have many cases for comparison. As such, the FDA cannot gauge their safety levels. So far, those that received a TUBA surgery have not suffered any serious side effects.</div>

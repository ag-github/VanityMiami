                <h3>Benefits of a Breast Augmentation or Breast Enhancement</h3>
                <p><strong>Breast Augmentation</strong> can enhance appearance and self-esteem. Women, who have undergone this surgical procedure tend to feel more confident leading to improvements in other areas of their lives.</p>
                <h3>Introduction to <strong>Breast Augmentation Miami</strong> Surgery</h3>
                <p>Breast Augmentation surgery or augmentation mammoplasty, is the surgical procedure used to increase the volume of the breasts and improve their symmetry by using implants. It is also aimed to restore breast volume lost after weight loss or pregnancy. In addition, this procedure can serve as breast reconstruction after mastectomy or injury which can enhance self-image and confidence of the patient.</p>
                <h3>Breast Implants Miami</h3>
                <p>There is now another option aside from <a href="/saline-breast-implants-miami/">saline breast implants</a>, Vanity Cosmetic Surgery Center offers <a href="/silicone-breast-implants-miami/">silicone gel implants</a>. At Vanity, the doctors will help you decide which type of implant is right for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <h3>How long do Breast Implants Surgery last?</h3>
            <p>Breast Implants can have a long life. So far, there is no way to predict how long any particular implant will last. Complications can occur such as painful scar tissue and ruptures; therefore, women may need to have them removed. In the event that a saline solution implant ruptures, the body will simply absorb the solution. On the other hand, if a silicone gel implant ruptures, the patient will need to have an MRI scan to detect and confirm that the implant has ruptured. If this were the case, your doctor will most likely recommend surgical removal and a new implant may be inserted at the same time.</p>
            <h3>Ideal Candidates for a <strong>Breast augmentation</strong> Miami</h3>
            <p>Most women become interested in breast augmentation when they have asymmetrical or sagging breasts as a result of age and pregnancy while others are just not comfortable with the size, shape, or feel of their breasts. Other women may need breast reconstruction after mastectomies, injuries or other related reasons. By Florida law, saline breast implants are available to women over the age of 18, while silicone breast implants are available to women over the age of 22. Our plastic and reconstructive surgeons at Vanity can help you determine whether or not you are a good candidate.

            <h3>How does Breast Augmentation surgery work?</h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_augmentation/breast-augmentation-miami-1.jpg"><img style="margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="mammoplasty miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_augmentation/breast-augmentation-miami-1.jpg" width="860" height="401"></a></p>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <p>Usually, implants are placed in one of four locations. The first location places the implant between the pectorals and the breast tissue. A woman with low pectoral tissue may sometimes develop wrinkles of the implants, also known as rippling. The second placement is below the fascia, or fibrous tissue of the pectoral muscle. This placement helps keep the implants in place. The implants may also be placed in the subpectoral plane. Some patients cannot handle this placement due to the movements of their pectoral muscles. The last placement is right beneath the pectoral muscle. Breast Augmentation Surgeons rarely perform this technique because it requires removing the muscle off the ribs. This technique may cause the breast to move in a deformed fashion. Patients must also choose the location of the incision site. This depends on the body type and personal preference of the patient. </p>

            <h2>Types of incisions for Breast Augmentation:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1.	The <strong>inframammary incision</strong> involves an incision below the inframammary fold. The plastic surgeons prefer this procedure with silicone gel implants. This technique gives them direct access to the pectoral muscles.</li>
                <li>2.	Periareolar technique include an incision around the border of the areola. This technique produces fewer scars and can be coupled with a breast lift.</li>
                <li>3. <a href="breast-augmentation-armpits-miami"><strong>Transaxillary</strong></a>, involves an incision in the armpits. From that incision, the implants can be fed into the breast area. This technique produces a scarless breast augmentation. However, it does require some fine tuning.</li>
                <li>4. <a href="/transumbilical-breast-augmentation-miami/"><strong>Transumbilical breast augmentation</strong></a>, or TUBA, involves a minor incision in the belly button. The doctor tunnels up the navel area into the breast. This technique also produces a scarless breast augmentation. However, it makes it more difficult to place silicone gel implants.</li>
                <li>5.	The breast implant surgery may be done either under local or general anesthesia. The procedure is done as a one-day outpatient surgery.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Risks related to Breast Augmentation</h2>
            <p>As any other type of surgery, there are potential risks and complications when you have a Breast Augmentation procedure. Such risks include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Patients may require additional surgery</li>
                <li>Capsular contracture.</li>
                <li>Implant ruptures.</li>
                <li>Infection.</li>
                <li>Physical suffering.</li>
                <li>Skin Wrinkling.</li>
                <li>Discontent with cosmetic results.</li>
                <li>Alteration of bust sensation.</li>
                <li>Necrosis.</li>
                <li>Risks and complications of surgery are best discussed on a personal basis between the patient and the plastic surgeon.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Miami Breast Augmentation Cost</h2>
            <p>Vanity Cosmetic Surgery offers the most competitive prices in South Florida, starting at $ 2,800 depending on the type and size of implant, patient characteristics, and type of incision.</p>
            <h2>Breast Implants Cost</h2>
            <h3> Saline vs Silicone</h3>
            <p>In the US, the average Breast Augmentation costs roughly from $3,500 to $10,000. The main determinant of the price has to do with the implants. Silicone implants usually cost between $800 and $2,000 more than saline implants. The size of each implant also increases the price. If the breasts come with a guarantee, it increases the price. Some guarantees come free with the breast implant. Replacement costs usually count as a second surgery, even with the guarantee.</p>
            <h3>Does my insurance cover Breast Implants?</h3>
            <p>When performed for cosmetic reasons, insurance does not cover breast implants. When performed as a corrective surgery, the insurance usually covers the implants. To be safe, you should give a letter to your surgeon from your insurance, which almost always guarantees complete coverage.</p>

            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_augmentation/breast-augmentation-miami-2.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Breast Augmentation Miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/breast_augmentation/breast-augmentation-miami-2.jpg" width="320" height="308"></a></p>
            <h3>Preparations before a Breast Augmentation Surgery</h3>
            <p>Before the surgery, the patient must undergo a breast implants consultation that includes a baseline mammography. The same mammogram should be performed after the surgical procedure. Patients must stop taking aspirin or other blood thinners (unless the surgeon advises to continue them for other medical conditions) two weeks prior to surgery. Patients are required to stop smoking a month before surgery. Smoking reduces the level of oxygen in the blood and can cause delayed healing. Arrangements must be done with a friend or a family member to drive the patient home after recovery, and if possible to stay home with the patient for a day or so. They must also inform their employers of the days to be missed due to surgery.</p>
            <h3>What to expect the day of the surgery</h3>
            <p>On the day of the surgery, the patient will be administered a mild sedative. When she falls asleep, the doctor applies general anesthesia. Once the surgery is complete, the doctor inserts drainage tubes and bandages on the newly operated breasts. The bandages are then covered with an elastic surgical bra for support. Afterwards, the patient is taken into recovery where she is monitored for progress. The patient will be allowed to go home after a few hours, unless the doctor decides the patient should stay overnight.</p>
            <h3>Recovery At Home</h3>
            <p>After the surgery, the patient must stay in bed for 48 hours. During that time, the patient may feel fatigued. For the following three weeks, the patient may be restricted from certain movements and may require help for household tasks until fully healed. During those weeks, the stitches will be removed. If the patients job does not involve bending or lifting, they may return to work after three days. After a few months, the incisions recover their natural color. It is likely that the breasts will stay swollen for at least a month. Depending on the procedure, the recovery time may be slower or faster. Overall, the TUBA surgery has the fastest recovery time and the least amount of complications. Patients must remember that breasts may continue to grow as the years pass.</p>
            <h3>Safety Home Measures</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Patients must have  their medicine and massage creams within easy reach.</li>
                <li> They must wear loose clothing that does not rub or put pressure over the operated area.</li>
                <li> Either a friend or a nurse must check up on them every so often.</li>
                <li> They must have a healthy supply of foods.</li>
                <li> When the surgeon removes the surgical bra, the patients must wear a sport support bra.</li>
                <li> Cream must be applied over the surgical scars at least once a day.</li>
                <li> Patients must have a friend look after their pets to avoid any harm from them.</li>
            </ol>

How do Doctors determine the appropriate size?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Doctors always take the patient’s opinion into consideration discussing the hopes for the outcome of surgery. Still, some factors must be taken into account. If the patient wants super large implants, it might not be advisable, with giant breasts come back problems. Doctors may show the patients some before and after pictures of patients with similar body types. Others recommend something called the rice test.

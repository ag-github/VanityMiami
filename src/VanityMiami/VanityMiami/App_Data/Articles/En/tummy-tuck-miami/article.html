            <h2 style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Tummy Tuck Miami Introduction</h2>
            <p>A Miami Abdominoplasty, commonly known as a Miami Tummy Tuck, ranks top five in popularity for cosmetic surgery procedures. From 1997 to 2001, the number of tummy tucks performed increased by 72 percent. Each patient had a specialized procedure in order to achieve optimal results. The skin can only stretch so far, though it can still return to its original form. The Abdominoplasty procedure entails removal of skin and fat, and the tightening of the abdominal musculature. Muscles sewed together form a sort of internal girdle. This procedure differs from liposuction (the cosmetic procedure which removes fat deposits). However, paring both procedures assures additional contouring and sculpting. Women who had more than one pregnancy, whose skin stretched beyond its elasticity, prefer this procedure. A protruding abdomen, disproportioned with the rest of the body, can be corrected with the tummy tuck procedure. The procedure facilitates the tightening of underlying stomach muscles which have loosened, weakened or separated as a result of pregnancy or fluctuating weight. It also aids in the flattening and reshaping of the abdomen. Stretch marks improve somewhat, especially those below the navel.</p>
            <p>Abdominoplasty (a major surgery),cannot substitute regular diet and exercise. This procedure should be performed only after all other methods have been exhausted, and weight has stabilized. While most tummy tuck procedures occur for cosmetic reasons, others undergo the procedure to correct weakened abdominal muscles, which causes medical problems such as back pain. In such a case, Tummy Tuck serves as a reconstructive surgery. Tummy Tucks cost more than a liposuction, and it requires longer recovery time. Long lasting results should be coupled with a physical routine of exercise and healthy diet. Both men and women can receive a Tummy Tuck. We, at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery, encourage patients to bring a list of questions to ask our doctor during your initial consultation.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Best Candidates for </span><strong style="font-size: 1.17em;">Tummy Tuck Miami</strong><span style="font-size: 1.17em;"> Procedures</span></p>
            <p>A good candidate for a tummy tuck would be anyone physically and emotionally healthy, within 25 pounds of their ideal weight, a non-smoker, and has realistic expectations.Women or men who have loose skin and fat concentrated in the abdomen will benefit from abdominoplasty. Anyone planning on having more children, or plans on losing more weight, should hold off on this procedure; until they arrive at desired weight and number of pregnancies. Formerly obese patients, who have laxity of the skin, lack elasticity for liposuction and have trouble spots with excess pockets of fat. They often undergo the tummy tuck procedure. Preferably, a tummy tuck must be performed in a non-smoking patient, in good general health and a stable weight. Woman who has skin stretched by multiple pregnancies or weight loss may find the procedure useful for the tightenning those muscles.</p>
            <h3>When should you avoid the abdominoplasty surgery?</h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/no-smoking.jpg"><img itemprop="image" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Preparing for tummy tuck surgery" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/stop-smoking-thumb7.jpg" width="110" height="110"></a>A smoker, or someone recently exposed to second-hand smoke should avoid surgery. Smoking decreases blood flow to the body’s tissue which results in prolonged wound healing, skin loss, infection, increase in scarring; plus a plethora of other related complications. Anyone who still plans on losing weight, as there will be more excess skin with more weight loss. The procedure should be postponed, until the patient reaches their desired weight. Any woman who plans on becoming pregnant again should postpone her tummy tuck, until after she has completed childbearing. Becoming pregnant again would reverse the procedure.</p>
            <h3>Tummy Tuck Process</h3>
            <p>Tummy tuck procedures vary in scope as well as area of concentration and can be frequently subdivided into categories. Time in the surgery room varies on the extent of each surgery. A complete abdominoplasty takes anywhere from 1 to 5 hours. A partial abdominoplasty takes from 1 to 2 hours. General anesthesia will be administered to the patient, and a horizontal incision made just above the pubic area. The length of the incision depends on the structure of the abdomen, the style of undergarments or bathing suits you prefer and how much skin’s removed. Incase of excess loose skin around the bellybutton, a second incision will be made around the navel and skin will be tightened with excess skin. Skin that contains stretch marks may be removed, and remaining stretch marks will be flattened and improved. You should hold realistic expectations about the marks that still remain or whose appearance did not improve. Complete abdominoplasty, from hipbone to hipbone in the abdomen, allows for contouring of skin, tissue and muscle; as all abdominal tissues can be exposed. The surgery will cut loose the naval, move your belly button and drainage, tubes beneath your skin for a few days. This will assist in healing. This liposuction refines the curves in the abdominal structure. Sometimes a dressing or a compressing garment must be placed over the operated area. The applied pressure helps drain fluid excesses. Patients who had excess weight loss or children usually seek out this operation.</p>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/tummy-tuck-miami-process.jpg"><img itemprop="image" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" title="Mini Tummy Tuck" alt="Tummy Tuck Miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/tummy-tuck-miami-process-thumb8.jpg" width="250" height="505"></a></p>
            <h4 class="newmain">Partial or Mini-abdominoplasty</h4>
            <p>Mini-adbominoplasties target fat deposits located below the navel and smaller patches of excess skin. During this procedure, the bellybutton will most likely not be moved. Sometimes, the bellybutton slips below the waist. The flap’s stitched back into its original position. The incision will be shorter than the complete abdominoplasty. Drainage tubes, after the surgery, may also be utilized. Recovery time’s shorter than traditional tummy tuck. Those who lost a moderate amount of weight prefer the incisions.</p>
            <h4>Tummy tuck with Liposuction procedure</h4>
            <p>Those two procedures can be performed at the same time with the tummy tuck for patients in Miami. The patients will obtain many benefits from it. Keep an eye on the quantity of C.C. (Amount of Fat that can be removed). Most of the time the abdominoplasty performed focuses on the flanks and waist. First, the doctor performs ultrasonic liposuction to remove excess of fat. Afterwards, liposuction must be performed on abdominal and excess tissues. It’s best to perform both, since it’s unnecessary to try to preserve excess tissues. Patients recover far more quickly. At most, they only spend 51 minutes in the recovery room.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Circumferential Abdominoplasty Procedure</span></p>
            <p>Circumferential Abdominoplasty, often known as a Belt Lipectomy or a “body lift”, differs from a traditional tummy tuck. It not only involves the abdominal area but the back, hip and waistline. This operation takes care of significant amounts of loose (inelastic), hanging skin that extends from the abdomen to the sides, flabby buttocks and thighs; belly fat and repositions the muscles. The procedure starts with a belt like incision made around the waist, and excess fat and skin must be removed. Upper skin and tissue must be pulled down and lower skin and tissue pulled up giving you a tighter and more youthful looking body. The scar will fade over time.</p>
            <h3>How should I prepare for my tummy tuck?</h3>
            <p>If you smoke, you need to stop smoking. At most, spend 6 weeks without smoking before getting operated. Cutting down will not be sufficient, as nicotine and smoke will infect and slow down the healing process. It also heightens many other medical complications. Doctors recommend quitting completely rather than just cutting down on smoking. Your doctor will instruct you on which medications and supplements. If you take any, they must be eliminated for a certain period prior to the surgery. Avoid taking Aspirin or Motrin.</p>
            <p>Be sure to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Proper nutrition plays a key role in healing properly. You must follow a high protein diet, for at least 3-5 weeks. Avoid constipation. Patients should prepare for an extended recovery after this procedure. You must avoid doing a crash diet. Rapid weight loss can be unhealthy. It lowers your immune system, and it worsens the risk of infections after the operation.</p>
            <h4>Postoperative preparations and Home Recovery Area</h4>
            <p>During your tummy tuck recovery, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and to stay with you for at least the next day or two. You should do a routine check with your doctor every week during your recovery period. Compression garments also help in the recovery. These help tighten the muscle and prevent tummy tuck scars. It has been reported that some patients experience mood swings after the operation. Some patients get depressed, others become hyperactive. Patients must keep in mind that these moods swings naturally occur after a serious operation. Patients should avoid heavy lifting or excessing during recovery period.</p>
            <h4>Preparations made at home in advance take priority for your comfort and recovery:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Animal/ Pet care should be arranged</li>
                <li>Comfortable bedding with extra blankets, anesthesia gives the “chills” after surgery</li>
                <li>Purchase all medications and dressings before hand</li>
                <li>Nightlights should be used at night, as medications can sometimes disorient you</li>
                <li>Place anything you will need during recovery at hip height, as you do not want to be lifting and reaching up</li>
                <li>Have lots of loose, comfortable clothing. (oversized t-shirts, baggy sweatpants or pajama bottoms)</li>
                <li>Gather things that will keep you entertained while you recover. For example, movies, video games, books, journals, music, laptop, etc.</li>
                <li>Wash your hair the night before surgery. It could be a few weeks before you shower.</li>
                <li>Purchase foods and snack that will alleviate nausea. (Crackers, gold fish, toast.)</li>
                <li>Take at least two weeks off work</li>
                <li>If you can, have a personal helper, a family member, a nurse or a friend always nearby.</li>
                <li>Keep in contact with your surgeon, just in case you start experiencing any complications. Do not be afraid to call in at any given time.</li>
                <li>Remember! Your wellbeing should be the only thing that matters.</li>
                <li>Stay in a room close to a bathroom</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Post-Surgery</h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/tummy-tuck-miami-garment.jpg"><img itemprop="image" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" title="After Tummy Tuck" alt="Post-abdominoplasty" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/tummy_tuck/tummy-tuck-miami-garment-thumb8.jpg" width="200" height="155"></a></p>
            <p>The amount of time required for surgery varies from patient to patient. Ages, health, elasticity of skin count among the variant factors of recovery. The day after surgery, patients should take short walks to increase circulation, which will aid in recovery. However, they will be unable to stand up straight. During the first days, avoid siting down for long periods of time. Certain activities should be limited during the early weeks of recovery. Straining, bending, and lifting must be avoided as these movements may cause increase swelling and bleeding. Scarring will heal and fade over time; although, they might pink and darken before they lighten. Some incision marking will remain permanently as a result of the procedure. Doctors generally prescribe oral medication to alleviate pain or discomfort. There might be a “tugging” sensation at your abdomen compression garments will aid in reducing swelling. Bruising and numbness of the skin, between the navel and the wound, should be expected. Drainage tubes will be in the wounds to help prevent fluid buildup.</p>
            <h4>Complications and side effects with a tummy tuck?</h4>
            <p>As with any surgery, there can be risks for side effects and complications. As expected, swelling, bruising and pain will occur following your surgery. Bleeding, infection and reactions to anesthesia can be possible side effects. Your doctor can prescribe you painkillers to help you manage the pain. Soreness may last for weeks and in some cases months. Numbness could also be a common side effect that can last up to a year. Potential side effects include infection, blood cost, effects of anesthesia, and poor wound healing. Your doctor will instruct and advise you on specifics to prevent complications. Scarring as a result of the procedure should also be taken into consideration.</p>
            <p>Very extensive abdominoplasty can cause tissue loss along the inscision line. Hematomas occur often in patients who smoke or suffer from diabetes. This happens when fluid collects under the skin after the drains have been removed. The fluid can be removed with a needle and all drainage stops within a month.</p>
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions about Tummy Tuck</h3>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I’m a forty year old woman who just gave birth to my second child and I’m not happy with the way I look after having two babies. How long do I have to wait to have a mommy makeover?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">You should wait at least three months before getting a tummy tuck. After the procedure, you will have 10-15 days of recovery. Avoid lifting heavy objects and picking up your children. Sometimes, it’s best to wait three months after you finished breastfeeding. The hormones generated by breastfeeding affect elasticity.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Doctor, I am trying to decide regular liposuction and laser liposuction. What’s the difference between them? Laser liposuction VS regular liposuction?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Laser liposuction has better results. This procedure can be done with local anesthesia. It has a shorter recovery period and it does not scar the tissue. Laser liposuction uses fine needles to suction out the fatty cells melted by the lasers. Traditional liposuction uses general anesthesia and larger needles. This ruptures the collagen beneath the skin, causing hematomas. After the procedure, the patients experiences swelling in the operated region for long periods of time.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Can I do liposuction in any part of my body?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Any area with an excess of fat can be operated. Such areas include abdomen, back or thighs. The chin or below the arms can also be operated, if they have excess of fat.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Why should I do a Slim Lipo, instead of another liposuction?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Slim Lipo specifically targets fat cells. Tissues receive minimal damage. It avoids burning the collagen areas. This allows for the skin to react better after the surgery.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I’ve dieted and exercised for years and I still have fatty areas. Can laser surgery fix me?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Sometimes, diets and exercise do not suffice. When all else fails, laser surgery can target specifically those fatty cells. After the surgery, all patients can be free of fatty deposits.</div>
            <h3>Tummy Tuck Cost</h3>
            <p>The cost of a tummy tuck varies regionally from city to city, state to state and country to country. Cost depends on factors such as:</p>

            <h3>Introduction to <strong>Liposuction Miami</strong> Surgery</h3>
            <p>
                Liposuction, or lipoplasty, is a cosmetic surgical procedure in which excess fatty tissue is removed from under the skin by suction. This procedure has become very popular and is considered to be the number one procedure requested to plastic surgeons today. The procedure can place greater accentuation on the body’s natural contours. Liposuction uses a hollow stainless steel tube known as a cannula and a suction device known as an aspirator to remove fat from the body’s subcutaneous deep fat layer through a variety of different possible techniques. Liposuction surgery can be used to treat fat pockets in many parts of the body including: abdomen and waist, thighs, hips and buttocks, arms, neck and back, chest, cheeks and chin, and calves and ankles.<br>
                Liposuction is not a treatment for obesity and is not a replacement for regular exercise and good eating habits.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                In some cases, liposuction is performed alone, in other cases it is used with other plastic surgery procedures such as a facelift, breast reduction, or a tummy tuck.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of Liposuction</h3>
            <p>Patients benefit both mentally and physically from liposuction. It is considered to be a safe and effective way to remove excess fat from the body. The benefits of liposuction includes, but is not limited to the improvement in the appearance of; cellulite, safe removal of fat, improvement of health usually associated with fat loss, sculpting areas of the body that even exercise do not seem to impact, and boost of self-esteem.</p>
            <h3>Ideal Candidates for <strong>Liposuction in Miami</strong></h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="Body sculpture miami photo" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami.jpg" width="196" height="147"></a></p>
            <p>Healthy individuals who have decided the liposuction will help them achieve their goals and do not have any medical condition or life-threatening sickness that can impair healing would be ideal for this procedure. Non- smoking patients bothered by excess fat deposits and individuals with a positive outlook and specific idea in mind for body contouring are also good candidates for liposuction.</p>
            <h3>How does Liposuction work?</h3>
            <p>Liposuction can be used for small areas, such as the space under the chin, or larger areas, such as buttocks and thighs. In both cases, a narrow tube (cannula) is inserted through a tiny incision, and used to vacuum the fat that lies deep beneath the skin. The cannula is pushed then pulled through the fat layer, breaking up the fat cells and suctioning them out by a vacuum pump or a large syringe. As the patients lose fluids along with fat, they are given intravenous fluids and carefully monitored.</p>
            <h2>Types of Liposuction Procedures</h2>
            <p>There are different and improved techniques to make Liposuction safer, easier, and less painful. These techniques consider the following:</p>
            <h3>Traditional Liposuction:</h3>
            <h4>Suction Assisted Liposuction (SAL)</h4>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/liposuction-miami-1.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="liposuction miami" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/liposuction-miami-1.jpg" width="203" height="250"></a></p>
            <h5>What is it?</h5>
            <p>It is a traditional method that uses a small cannula attached to a pressurized vacuum. The surgeon operates the cannula manually. The medicated saline solution is introduced into the area being treated and small incisions are made into the layer of fat. The cannula is inserted through the incisions and manipulated, which breaks up fat so it can be suctioned out of the body.</p>
            <h5>Advantages</h5>
            <p>Suction Assisted Liposuction is the best way to remove huge fat masses in short time. That is the reason it is used in correction of large body areas such as abdomen, buttocks or back. One more quality which attracts patients to choose traditional liposuction is the price. Compared with other types of liposuction, expenses for SAL can be ten times lower. Some medical conditions may also benefit from liposuction, including gynecomastia, where fatty breast tissue has developed in men, as well as lipomas, benign fatty tumors. Results may last permanently depending on the patient’s eating habits. It is important to maintain good physical health as well.</p>
            <h5>Risks of <strong>Suction Assisted Liposuction</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Like any other medical procedure, there may be complications involved. Before you have liposuction, you should be aware of the risks and benefits based on your own personal value system.<br>
                Risks can go from swelling or numbness in the area, irritation where the cannula is inserted, and color changes in the treated area. Fluid imbalance is another complication that may occur which staff will be watching for while the patient is still in the office. However, this may happen after you go home. Swelling may also occur after liposuction. In some cases, swelling may persist for weeks or months after liposuction. Embolism is also possible when fat is loosened and enters the blood and pieces of fat get trapped in the blood vessels, gather in the lungs, or travel to the brain.
            </p>
            <h4>Power Assisted Liposuction (PAL)</h4>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami-1.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="liposuction-miami,hialeah,broward" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/suction-assisted-liposuction-miami-1.jpg" width="229" height="200"></a></p>
            <h5>What is it?</h5>
            <p>This method consists of a mechanical cannula that extracts fat with smaller incisions and a more precise and shorter surgical experience. It reduces the amount of manual force and physical effort required to perform lipoplasty, especially in areas with fibrous tissue. This innovation does not use heat. Therefore, there are no concerns for the accidental burning that can occur with other systems. The result is a more comfortable experience for both the surgeon and the patient.</p>
            <h5>Advantages</h5>
            <p>During Power Assisted Liposuction, doctors do not need to use much force since the vibrating cannula helps release fat cells from the body. Bruising and recovery time are significantly short. The Power Assisted Liposuction procedure takes less time to perform than manual liposuction; thus, complications and risks are reduced.</p>
            <h5>Risks of a Power Assisted <strong>Liposuction</strong></h5>
            <p>There are minimal risks associated with the Power Assisted Liposuction. Patients can experience loose, uneven and/or wrinkled skin, which may tighten over time. Some patients may experience moderate changes in skin pigmentation.</p>
            <h3>Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction (UAL)</h3>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/lipsuction-miami-2.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="liposuction-miami,hialeah,broward" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/liposuction/lipsuction-miami-2.jpg" width="270" height="469"></a></p>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>Unlike lasers and suction, this technique uses ultrasound to liquefy the fat, making it easier to remove. This method is believed to be more efficient and less traumatic than other procedures. This operation can be done in two different fashions. The fat can be drained as it gets liquefied, or it can be drained after it gets liquidized. This method can be done in the back, abdomen, and male breast region.</p>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>Ultrasound Assisted Liposuction produces smoother, softer results. It gives the doctor more control over shaping the contours of the body. It also reduces traumas, bruising, and bleeding damages. Both men and women can benefit from this plastic surgery. UAL allows better definition of areas like waist, rib cage, and arms.</p>
            <h4>Risks of an Ultrasonic Assisted <strong>Liposuction Miami</strong></h4>
            <p>While effectively treating the fat, continuous ultrasound energy can burn the patient’s skin. This is not a frequent event.</p>
            <h3>Laser Liposuction</h3>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>Laser liposuction is minimally invasive treatment that can help patients get rid of localized fat without undergoing a traditional liposuction treatment. This type of liposuction can treat areas such as knees, back, chest, abdomen, hips, thighs, and male breasts. Compared to traditional liposuction methods, laser liposuction results in less bleeding, bruising, and recovery time.</p>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>Laser liposuction works great in all the cases irrespective of the body types. The laser beam helps in fine tuning the body to give the patients best outlooks. Since laser liposuction is non-invasive it has a shorter recovery period. Patients can usually get back to work just after a day’s rest. The effects of laser liposuction are permanent since the fat cells are inactivated by the laser beam, leaving them incapable of storing more fat. Another benefit of laser liposuction is that it aids in growth of new collagen which gives the skin a more turgid and vital look. The laser also assists in sealing the smaller damaged blood vessels, reducing bleeding and inflammation.</p>
            <h4>Risks of Laser Liposuction</h4>
            <p>Laser Liposuction involves thermal energy, thus, the risk of blistering and burning tissues does exist. This could result in infection and scarring. The risk of irregularities in the skin and contour are also present; patients may experience wavy skin texture or dimpling mainly in the areas that have been treated. In addition, there could be dark or light skin discoloration that fades with the passing time or in worst cases require other treatments.</p>
            <h2>Recovery</h2>
            <p>Like any other procedure, liposuction has a recovery period. The liposuction recovery period can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. The recovery can be uncomfortable, and during the first few weeks most people experience varying degrees of pain, burning, swelling, and temporary numbness. During this period, it is important to know how to care for the body parts that were treated. These areas get wrapped firmly. The doctor may recommend wraps or compression garments several weeks after surgery to expedite the recovery. This also helps better tone the body and reduce swelling. Bandages will be changed after one to two days and any drains and sutures left in after liposuction will be removed after five to ten days. The stitches will either dissolve or be removed by the surgeon eight or ten days after the surgery. After a few weeks, the patient should feel comfortable enough to remove the compression garment. Swelling will continue to go down and the final result will start to be revealed. Doctors may recommend antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection at the incision sites.</p>
            <h2>Liposuction Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Can the SAL surgery be performed in my arms?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Yes, it can be performed in different parts of the body including the arms.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>How does Suction Assisted Liposuction work with fat grafting?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Fat can accumulate in places that are not desirable. It can be removed during Suction Liposuction and now, with improved techniques of fat transfer, the fat can be harvested and grafted elsewhere with greater success. This is normally a relatively quick procedure. Patients that undergo this procedure will have fat from their abdomen or other parts of their body transferred over to the buttocks, breasts, and face.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>How much weight should I lose before getting any type of Liposuction Surgery? What would be 20 pounds about someone’s ideal weight?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Each person has an ideal weight based on their height. For women, they have a higher ideal weight margin than the men. This mostly has to do with their breast and other factors that add extra weight. Let’s just say, your ideal weight would be 145 pounds. Then you add 20 pounds to that amount and then you have the weight you need before you get a liposuction.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Is it better to have Liposuction before or after pregnancy?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">It depends on whether you want to enjoy the results now or later.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Which Liposuction surgery works better, PAL or SAL?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Both plastic surgery techniques work just as well. Power Assisted Liposuction simply adds vibrations to the straw like cannula used in the Suction Assisted Liposuction. Some doctors may prefer SAL over PAL, since SAL gives them more manual control. PAL on the other hand creates a more cohesive, predictable pattern of fat removal. In the end, it all depends on the ability and experience of the plastic.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>What method of Liposuction should I get?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Liposuction can be performed on several areas of the body at the same time, and in certain cases it can also be done in conjunction with other aesthetic procedures. Because of individual physical factors, not everyone will achieve the same results from liposuction. The surgeon will take into consideration your unique characteristics in determining the most effective treatment for you.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Does Liposuction get rid of cellulite?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Liposuction does reduce the degree of cellulite, but it does not eliminate it.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Does Liposuction entail any life threatening risks?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Liposuction, like any other surgery, has some risks factors. Complications rarely occur. The most common issues with liposuction include small irregularities or asymmetries over the treated area. To reduce these irregularities, the surgeon sculpts the remaining fat into a form that goes with your body contours. In this respect, the surgeon acts more like an artist than a doctor.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>What type of Liposuction technique is used to perform Liposuction at Vanity?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The industry of liposuction has expanded enormously in the past five years, and it seems like just as you got into one technique a whole new one just came out. I still strongly feel that it really comes down to the surgeons experience, as the machine won’t make you a better liposuction surgeon, it’s the experience behind the cannula, and that’s the most essential thing; so, there are a number of techniques, they’re all good, but it really comes down to who is doing that liposuction procedure and their artistic eye in really giving a great result to that patient.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Why should a patient do a Slim Lipo over another kind of Lipo?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The Slim Liposuction method is a new revolutionary procedure achieved, by producing destruction of cells of fat. This causes less damage to fat tissue around and burns less of the structure which produces a stimulation of collagen, giving a better reaction to the skin after surgery leaving a better contour of the body after liposuction.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I go to the gym regularly; however, I still have some areas that cannot eliminate with exercise. Will Laser Liposuction be helpful?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Laser Liposuction is recommended for fat deposits that cannot disappear with exercise or diet. It also promotes smoother and tighter skin tone. Patients considering this procedure should be in good overall health and near their ideal body weight.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Are post-procedure massages parts of the treatment?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">The massages are very important. They ensure to the patient that the areas treated are all equal and the contour is as natural as possible. The patient should begin the massage treatments as soon as possible, within a day or two of the procedure. We recommend the patient has at least 10 sessions; they may come two to three times a week.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>How long does Laser Liposuction take?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">It usually takes about 45 minutes for each area treated.</div>
            <h2>Liposuction Prices</h2>
            <h3>How much does the liposuction cost?</h3>
            <p>Though the quality of liposuction is more important than the cost of a liposuction, cost is an important factor when considering this surgery. National average costs for liposuction can run from $3000.00 to $8000.00. The cost can vary depending on a variety of factors such as anesthesia to be used, part of the body to be suctioned, and so on. The liposuction can be combined with another surgical procedure and offered as a package, this will also lower the cost of both as a whole. The cost of liposuction at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery goes from $1500.00 to $8000.00.</p>

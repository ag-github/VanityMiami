            <h1 itemprop="title">Introduction to Otoplasty Miami Procedure</h1>
            <p>Otoplasty had been widely practice in India, since 5<sup>th</sup> century BC. Much of the modern day, Otoplasty techniques draw from that ancient tradition. Otoplasty, in essence, means shaping of the ear. When perfumed, the patients want to alter the shape, not the function of the ear. Usually, older men and women with very large ears, undergo this process. Others who receive the surgery have overly large conchal bowl. As a corrective surgery, Otoplasty can correct ear birth defects or malformations that occurred as a result of injury.</p>
            <p>Usually, this process gets done with local anesthesia. Some patients cannot sit still for hours. For fidgety patients, a mild sedative may be applied to have them sleep through the operation. Everyone, ranging from older to children can get an ear surgery. If protruding ears bothers your child, he may be eligible for surgery. Even a mild change can help the patient feel better about their appearance.</p>
            <h2>How does Otoplasty Miami work?</h2>
            <p>The method of the surgery depends on the area that needs correction. For the most part, the incisions made in the ear have a post exterior aspect. Onlookers would have to tear apart the ear for them to tell that it underwent any plastic surgery. When it comes to serious birth defects, the ear might need complete reconstruction. In general, the doctors use local anesthesia, local anesthesia with sedatives, or general anesthesia (for children). Overall, the doctors may use either surgical or nonsurgical techniques. The surgeon may combine both techniques to get the optimal results.</p>
            <h2>Surgical Types</h2>
            <h3>Antithetical Fold Manipulation</h3>
            <p>Antithetical fold, found roughly at the center of the ear, has a Y shaped form. Usually, people with a congenital ear deformity get an antithetical fold manipulation. They usually lack sufficient cartilage to form a complete ear. The doctor thus removes tissue from behind the ear to complete the ear. First the surgeon makes a surgical wound on the cartilage of the ear at the antithetical fold. By applying pressure, the surgeon further defines the shape. At other times, the doctor may rough up the front surface of the antithetical fold. This forces the cartilage to bend backwards toward the well-defined portion of the ear. A full incision allows the doctor to correct the antithetical by applying a little bit of force.</p>
            <h3>Conchal Alteration Otoplasty Procedure Miami</h3>
            <p>The conchal, an irregular shaped bowl, can be found right before the ear hole. If misshapen it affects the form of the antihetical fold. In this revision, the doctor decreases the angle of the conchal by 25 degrees. He then sutures the conchal into the mastoid fascia, a bone bellow the ear. In another version, the doctor removes some of the thickness of the conchal. This removes some of its protuberance without harming the rest of the ear. The doctor then sutures the conchal defected to hide the otoplasty scars. At other times, the doctor may combine both techniques to receive the desired the effect.</p>
            <h3>Correction of Earlobe Prominence</h3>
            <p>Reconstructing the earlobe takes time and patience; mostly, because the external ear has been moved two thirds up. This shift, combined with a prominent earlobe, makes the ear look disproportionately big in comparison with the rest of the head. First, the doctor cuts the skin over the medial surface of the earlobe. He then takes off a small bite of the conchal undersurface. Lastly, he pulls the earlobe toward the region he removed from the conchal. He sutures both together, thus effecting the change.</p>
            <p><a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/otoplasty/otoplasty-miami-2.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; border: 3px solid #E9EAEE;" alt="otoplasty miami, hialeah, broward" src="/Content/themes/avada/img/procedures/otoplasty/otoplasty-miami-2.jpg" width="350" height="243"></a></p>
            <h3>Alteration of the position of the auricular upper pole</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, the upper third of the pinna has too much prominence. When the operation of the Antithetical fold does not help, surgical correction may be needed. The first alteration focuses on ear augmentation. Basically, the doctor adds extra cartilage to the under developed areas of the ears. This cartilage may be taken from other parts of the ear or the rib cage. This change corrects the underdeveloped or absent pinna, or external ear. In an ear pin back, the patient needs their ear flattened against their head. The surgeon makes an incision behind the external ear. He then cuts a small tunnel along the front of the badly form Antihelix, of the tail part of the Y. Then, he loosens the conchal and moves it closes to the head, after he removes excess skin. The doctors then sutures the Antithetical fold, in order to have the earlobe match the proportion of the pinna. In an ear reduction, the doctor cuts excess tissue from any prominent part of the ear.</p>
            <h3>Non-Surgical</h3>
            <p>About 20-30% of babies come to this world with deformed ears. Such deformities usually get corrected automatically by the baby’s body, within the first week. The non-surgical methods can correct bat ears, elf ears, lack of curvature of the top part of the ear, flattened cauliflower ear, ect. This operation can be done on infant children. The infant has more malleable pinna, due to remnants of its mother’s estrogen circulating in his blood. During that time, such minor birth defects can be easily corrected. Via the methods of Taping, Designed splits, EarWell, and Ear Buddies the defect can be corrected. These techniques can only be used effectively in during the first 6 weeks.</p>
            <h3>Taping</h3>
            <p>Taping, the nonsurgical alternative for infants, can correct the infant’s bat ears. The taping technique involves taping the ears to the head. The tape varies in kind and texture. It can also be coupled with surgical splits or molds that shape the ear. The baby needs regular replacements of splits and tape, to avoid skin erosion. Remember, babies have delicate skin.</p>
            <h3>Physician designed splits</h3>
            <p>Designed splits correct congenital defects of elf ears, prominent ears or constricted ears. The doctor performs the split using a wire core segment, using a French Silastic Tube. Depending on the deformity, the doctor may design a unique wire core for the patient. This tube gets affixed by the tape. The devise stays in the ear for at least, 3 to 4 weeks. This fix does not require anesthesia.</p>
            <h3>EarWell</h3>
            <p>The EarWell corrects infant ear deformities. If treated within the first week, the results can equate those obtained from a surgery. Basically, the EarWell acts like a tissue molding device. It comes in four forms, depending on the part of the ear that needs correcting. A posterior shell placed around the ear molds the general shape of the ear. A retractor shapes the form of the pinna. The conchal former molds the conchal. The anterior shell protects the entire ear. These devices put together form the EarWell.</p>
            <h3>Ear Buddies</h3>
            <p>The Ear Buddies serves as a molding device that corrects an ear deformity. Basically, the corrective split gets inserted into the gull of the defective ear. Its then rolled over the edge of the ear and fastened together with tape. The Ear Buddy then gets taped to the side of the head. Infants must wear this devise all 24 hours of the day. Depending on when he received the device, he may need to wear it for less time. For infants who received the mold at birth, they only require to wear it for 2 weeks. For those that received it after 6 months, they must wear it for 4 months. The longer they parents wait, the longer their infant child must wear the split. Before putting on the split, the infant’s ear gets cleaned of dead skins and oil. This allows the tape to get glue to the baby’s head. The tape cannot be fastened too tightly to allow the skin to breathe.</p>
            <h3>Complete and Utter Ear Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>Patients who had an accident, cancer, a terrible deformity or no ears require reconstructive surgery. To reconstruct the entire ear, the surgeon takes cartilage from the patient’s ribs. This cartilage then gets structured into the patient’s skin, on the location where the new ear gets reconstructed. &nbsp;This skin then envelopes the ear prosthesis. Once in place, the surgeon recreates the pinna and all the other key structures needed to form the ear. In the follow up surgeries, the surgeon forms the earlobe while separating the pinna from the rest of the head.</p>

            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Like any operation, Ear Surgery has some risks worth noting. With surgical corrections, the patient runs the risk having their ear scarred. Luckily, the otoplasty scars remain hidden behind your ear. Changes during the healing process may make your ears asymmetrical. Sometimes, stiches may rise to the surface of the skin, and may need to be removed. This may cause inflammation in the skin and may require the patient to undergo surgery. Other problems include over corrections which makes the ear look unnatural. Sometimes the ear may get an infection or a blood clot. At worst, patients may see a gradual reversal of the surgery. Another complication involves numbing of the operated area.</p>
            <h2>Preparations before the Operation</h2>
            <p>Before the operation, the parents must have a serious conversation with their child. Parents must then take their child to the preliminary consultation. They need to inform the school of how many days their child needs to miss. They also need someone to take care of them at all times. Putting age aside, the patient must stop taking aspirin for at least two weeks before the operation. For smokers and alcohol drinkers, they must stop for at least two weeks, as well. &nbsp;All patients need a clean bill of health before undergoing the operation. They must also cut their hair short or braid their long hair. This gives the doctor more freedom during the operation. You must tell your doctor about all the medicine you take. Patients should stock up on prescribed pain medications. These medications usually must be taken for at least 2 to 3 days.</p>
            <h2>Operation Procedures</h2>
            <p>In the day of the surgery, the patients must wear loose clothing. They should avoid restrictive collars that must be pulled over their heads. For children, they must avoid wearing, in the future, anything that bends or pulls at their ear. Once the patients best rest comfortably in the surgical bed, the otoplasty specialist applies the anesthesia. Depending on the age, the otoplasty surgeon may use general or local anesthesia. The procedure roughly takes two hours, depending operation. Children and some adults may require staying in the hospital overnight. Most adults should plan to have someone drive them home or look after them during their hospital stay.</p>
            <h2>Recovery</h2>
            <p>During the first few days, the patient has to wear a bandage dressing over the ears. The patient must avoid putting pressure over their newly operated ears. Needless to say, they must sleep on their backs. When showering, patients must avoid getting the dressings wet. After removing the bandages, the patients have to wear a loose headband, covering the ears, before sleeping. A tight headband may erode the surface of the ear and reopen the wound. Excessive rubbing or pressure may cause necrosis, or premature death of skin cells, in the ear.</p>
            <p>Depending on the procedure, the recovery time may range from 7 to 10 days. Some patients may return to work after 72 hours, depending on their hair style. Even after the recovery period, for 10 weeks the patient must avoid straining the ear. Bruising and swelling of the ears usually lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Children may return to school after four days. Still, they should not do physical education for at least three weeks. As for adult patients, for three weeks they should not do any aerobics, bending, lifting or straining since it delays the healing process. After surgery, the patient should eat only liquids. They should advance to solids at their own discretion. They must always drink plenty of liquid to avoid dehydration.</p>
            <h2>Otoplasty Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Doctor, in school they call me bat boy and Dumbo. Can you do something about my big ears?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Worry not, my boy! At any age, you can receive an ear surgery to correct your bat ears. This safe procedure can allow you to see the difference, soon after the surgery.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Doctor, at what age may I take my child to an ear surgery?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Usually, children start getting teased at the age of 8. Preferably, the child should come sooner. The ear usually matures between the ages of five and six. I recommend your child comes for surgery during that time period.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Will the surgery drastically change my appearance?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">My patients have told me that their friends do notice a change. They usually attribute the change to an imaginary change, hairstyle or “something”. They cannot pin point any difference, per say. Rather, they claim that the patient, overall, has a prettier looking face.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Another question doctor, how much will my ears change?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Look, a patient should have a realistic expectation about their new ears. A good plastic surgeon can tell you if you have an unrealistic goal.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>Doctor, I never had an operation before. I am afraid of waking up during the procedure. Has it happen before?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">In this operation, we combine local anesthesia with sedatives. Needless to say, you will sleep through the process. You will not hear or feel anything. I recommend you do not drive for at least 24 hours after the operation.</div>
            <h5 class="toggle "><a href="#"><span class="arrow"></span>I only have one ear that needs to be set back. Can you just operate on that one and leave the other one alone?</a></h5><div class="toggle-content " style="display: none;">Sometimes, only one ear gets a deformity. At other times, one ear has a partial deformity while the other looks greatly deformed. Doctors usually operated on both ears to make certain that they both look identical after the operation. IF you prefer, you can have one ear operated. However, you run the chance of having ears that do not look alike.</div>
            <h2>Otoplasty Cost</h2>
            <p>Depending on the method, Otoplasty prices range from $1700- $7000. Complete ear reconstruction costs the most.</p>
            <h3>Does my Insurance cover Otoplasty?</h3>
            <p>
                The insurance does cover otoplasty when it corrects a deformity or a congenital defect. You must speak with your insurance company to discover what it exactly covers. You can ask your surgeon to write a letter to your insurance explaining the nature of the surgery. When you receive a surgery for cosmetic reasons, the insurance does not cover it.
